Agent: Email Follow-up Reminder20 minutes ago
ID: email-follow-up-reminder-697193e459a8d688e24a5b67
Log file: None
Regulation: PCI-DSS
============================================================

Here is the assessment based on the provided Agent Definition.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **Email Follow-up Reminder** agent integrates with a user's Gmail account to automate follow-ups. Its workflow is as follows:
1.  **Trigger:** It monitors the `onGmailMessageSent` stream to detect when the user sends an email.
2.  **Analysis:** It passes the email body to an LLM to determine if the email explicitly "Requires Response."
3.  **Wait:** If a response is required, it initiates a 3-day timer.
4.  **Check:** After 3 days, it checks if a reply has been received from the recipient.
5.  **Action:** If no reply is detected, it generates a draft follow-up email using an LLM and saves it to the user's drafts folder.

### 2. PCI-DSS Applicability
**Applicability:** **Not Applicable (Conditional)**

PCI-DSS applies to systems that store, process, or transmit Cardholder Data (CHD) or Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD).
*   **Intended Use:** This agent is designed for general business communication (follow-ups), not for processing payments or handling financial transaction records.
*   **Environment:** The agent operates within the email infrastructure (Gmail). Under **PCI-DSS Requirement 4.2**, organizations are strictly prohibited from sending unprotected primary account numbers (PANs) via end-user messaging technologies, including email.
*   **Conclusion:** Provided your organization follows standard PCI-DSS protocols by blocking CHD from entering the email stream (e.g., via Data Loss Prevention tools), this agent does not fall within the scope of the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE).

### 3. Specific Violations
Based on the provided definition and the strict "no speculation" constraint, **no definitive PCI-DSS violations are found** within the agent's logic or configuration.

*   **No Payment Processing:** The agent has no nodes or logic designed to request, parse, or store credit card numbers.
*   **No CDE Interconnection:** The agent connects only to Google Workspace (Gmail, Drive, etc.) and the Lindy/LLM inference layer. It does not connect to payment gateways or financial databases.

**Note on General Security Risk (Non-PCI):**
While not a PCI violation, the agent requests **Excessive Permissions**. The definition shows the agent requests scopes for `drive`, `spreadsheets`, `calendar`, and `documents`, yet the logic flow *only* utilizes `gmail` triggers and actions. This violates the **Principle of Least Privilege**, creating a broader attack surface than necessary, though it does not inherently violate PCI-DSS unless those locations contain unencrypted CHD.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
Although the agent is compliant with PCI-DSS based on its definition, the following actions are recommended to maintain organizational security:

1.  **Verify Email DLP:** Ensure your organization has **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** rules active on the email gateway to scrub or block any Credit Card numbers before they are sent or received. This prevents the agent (and its underlying LLM) from accidentally ingesting CHD.
2.  **Scope Reduction (Critical):** The agent's authentication configuration (`auth.scopes`) is over-provisioned.
    *   **Current:** Includes `drive`, `drive.readonly`, `spreadsheets`, `calendar.events`.
    *   **Required:** Only `gmail.readonly`, `gmail.compose`, and `gmail.send` are used in the workflow.
    *   **Action:** Modify the agent manifest to remove all non-Gmail scopes to limit potential data exposure.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Rating: Compliant**

*The agent does not inherently violate PCI-DSS. Any potential PCI risk derives solely from user misuse (emailing credit card numbers), which is an organizational policy violation separate from the agent's software definition.*
