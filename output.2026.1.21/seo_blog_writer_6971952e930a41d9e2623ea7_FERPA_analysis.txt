Agent: SEO Blog Writer
ID: seo-blog-writer-6971952e930a41d9e2623ea7
Log file: None
Regulation: FERPA
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition `[AGENT_DEFINITION]`, here is the security and compliance assessment regarding FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act).

**Note:** You mentioned a `[SAMPLE_LOG]` but it was not included in the prompt. This assessment is based strictly on the definitive logic and configuration provided in the JSON agent definition.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **SEO Blog Writer** agent is a marketing and content generation tool. Its workflow is as follows:
*   **Input:** It solicits marketing inputs from the user (topic, target audience, brand voice, website URL).
*   **Research:** It uses the **Perplexity** tool to perform public web searches ("Analyze Website & Brand" and "Research Topic & Keywords") to gather context and SEO data.
*   **Processing:** It utilizes an LLM to synthesize this information into a 1500+ word blog post, optimized for search engines.
*   **Output:** It generates a title, blog body, and meta description, delivering them via chat.

### 2. FERPA Applicability
**Verdict: NOT APPLICABLE**

**Reasoning:**
FERPA (20 U.S.C. § 1232g) protects the privacy of **student education records** (files, documents, and materials containing information directly related to a student) maintained by an educational agency or institution.

This agent is explicitly designed for **public marketing and Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**.
*   The data inputs required (keywords, brand voice, public website links) are non-confidential business/marketing data.
*   The data outputs (blog posts) are intended for public consumption on the open web.
*   There is no mechanism, instruction, or tool capability in the provided definition that requests, accesses, stores, or processes student PII (Personally Identifiable Information), grades, transcripts, or disciplinary records.

### 3. Specific Violations
**Verdict: NONE**

**Analysis:**
*   **No Access to Protected Records:** The agent’s external tools (Perplexity) are configured to search the public web (`search_mode: web`). It does not connect to internal Student Information Systems (SIS) or Learning Management Systems (LMS).
*   **No PII Solicitation:** The prompts in the `EntryPoint` and `ActionNode` request generic data ("Target audience", "Target topic") rather than specific student identifiers.
*   **No Unauthorized Disclosure:** As the agent does not ingest protected records, it cannot improperly disclose them.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
While the agent is compliant by design, the following standard operational security (OpSec) recommendation applies to prevent user error:

1.  **Usage Policy Warning:** Although the agent asks for a "Target Audience," ensure users are trained **not** to upload specific lists of student names or identifiers into the chat context to generate targeted content (e.g., "Write a blog post targeting these 5 specific failing students").
2.  **No Technical Remediation Required:** The agent configuration requires no changes.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**RATING: COMPLIANT**

This agent introduces no regulatory risk regarding FERPA as its function is entirely outside the scope of student education records.
