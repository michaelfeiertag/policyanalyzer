ID: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
Log file: None
Regulation: PCI-DSS
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition (`board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087`), here is the assessment regarding PCI-DSS compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Board meeting monitor" agent performs the following automated tasks:
*   **Trigger:** Activates twice daily via a recurring timer (at 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM).
*   **Input:** Queries an associated Google Calendar account to find "board meetings" scheduled for the following day that start before 9:00 AM PT.
*   **Logic:** Differentiates processing based on the time of day the agent runs (morning vs. afternoon).
*   **Output:**
    *   If morning: Sends an email summary via **Gmail** to a specific recipient (`m@testco.com`).
    *   If afternoon: Sends an SMS summary via **Twilio** to a specific phone number (`+14155312776`).

### 2. PCI-DSS Applicability
**Determination: Not Applicable (Out of Scope)**

**Reasoning:**
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) applies specifically to entities that store, process, or transmit Cardholder Data (CHD) or Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD). The primary data element that triggers PCI-DSS scope is the Primary Account Number (PAN)—i.e., the credit card number.

*   **Data Sources:** This agent accesses **Google Calendar** event data (titles, times, attendees, descriptions). Standard calendar data does not contain financial payment information.
*   **Data Destinations:** The agent transmits text-based summaries via **Gmail** and **Twilio** (SMS).
*   **Integration:** There are no integrations with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal), point-of-sale systems, or financial databases defined in the agent's configuration.

As the agent is strictly designed for calendar scheduling and notification, it does not interact with the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE).

### 3. Specific Violations of PCI-DSS
**Findings: None.**

Because the agent does not handle payment card data, there are no violations of PCI-DSS requirements.

*   **Requirement 4.2 (Transmitting PAN via end-user messaging):** While PCI-DSS forbids sending PANs via SMS or Email, this would only be a violation if the calendar events themselves contained credit card numbers in their description fields. As stated in your instructions to avoid speculation, there is no evidence in the configuration that this agent is intended to scrape or transmit payment data.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
Since the agent is out of scope for PCI-DSS, no remediation is required to achieve compliance.

**General Security Hygiene (Best Practice):**
*   Ensure organization-wide policies prohibit employees from entering credit card numbers into Google Calendar event descriptions or titles. If this policy is followed, this agent remains permanently out of scope for PCI-DSS.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Rating: Compliant**
*(Specifically: Out of Scope)*
