Agent: SEO Blog Writer
ID: seo-blog-writer-6971952e930a41d9e2623ea7
Log file: None
Regulation: PSD2
============================================================

Based on the review of the [AGENT_DEFINITION] provided, here is the assessment regarding PSD2 compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **SEO Blog Writer** is a content generation agent designed to produce search-engine-optimized articles. Its workflow consists of:
*   **Input Collection:** Receiving a topic, target audience, and website link from the user.
*   **Research:** Using the Perplexity API (`sonar` model) to analyze the provided website for brand voice and to research the target keywords.
*   **Generation:** Synthesizing the research into a long-form blog post (1500+ words) with specific formatting (H1-H3 headers).
*   **Output:** Delivering the drafted content and meta descriptions back to the user via chat.

### 2. PSD2 Applicability
**PSD2 is NOT applicable to this agent.**

**Reasoning:**
The Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) regulates payment services and payment service providers (PSPs) within the European Union. Its scope is strictly limited to:
*   **Account Information Services (AIS):** Aggregating or retrieving data from payment accounts.
*   **Payment Initiation Services (PIS):** Initiating transfers or payments on behalf of a user.
*   **Payment Processing:** Executing financial transactions.

The SEO Blog Writer agent performs **no financial functions**. It strictly processes public web data (via Perplexity) and generates text. It does not access bank APIs, handle payment credentials, process transactions, or interface with financial institutions.

### 3. Specific Violations of PSD2
**None.**

As the agent operates entirely outside the regulatory perimeter of PSD2, it cannot violate the directive. There are no instances of:
*   Unauthorized access to payment accounts.
*   Failure to perform Strong Customer Authentication (SCA).
*   Mishandling of financial credentials.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **No remediation is required regarding PSD2.**
*   **General Note:** Ensure standard data privacy controls are in place if the agent is asked to write about specific individuals (GDPR), but this is unrelated to payment regulations.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT** (Regulation Not Applicable)
