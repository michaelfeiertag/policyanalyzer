Log file: None
Regulation: EU-AI-Act
============================================================

Based on the review of the [AGENT_DEFINITION] provided, here is the security and compliance assessment regarding the EU AI Act.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **"Recruiting Agent"** is an automated recruitment system designed to identify, filter, and contact potential job candidates.
*   **Data Sourcing:** It utilizes "People Data Labs" to search for individuals based on specific criteria (Role, Location, Industry, Skills, **Gender**, Company).
*   **Data Processing:** It aggregates PII (Personal Identifiable Information) including personal emails, mobile phones, and employment history into Google Sheets.
*   **Action:** It creates a markdown table of leads and includes a logic loop to automate sending emails to these individuals via Gmail.

### 2. EU AI Act Applicability
**YES, the EU AI Act is applicable.**

*   **Territorial Scope (Article 2):** If your enterprise operates in the EU, or if the system creates outputs (recruitment decisions/outreach) used within the EU, the Act applies.
*   **Classification (Article 6 & Annex III):** This agent is definitively classified as a **High-Risk AI System**.
    *   **Reference:** *Annex III, Paragraph 4(a)*: "AI systems intended to be used for recruitment or selection of natural persons, notably for placing targeted job advertisements, analysing and filtering job applications, and evaluating candidates."
    *   **Reasoning:** The agent explicitly filters natural persons ("Search for leads") for the purpose of recruitment and employment.

### 3. Specific Violations
The following are definitive, significant violations found in the agent's configuration:

**A. Violation of Non-Discrimination and Data Governance (Article 10 & Fundamental Rights)**
*   **Finding:** In the `Search for leads` ActionNode (ID: `695f41b990cb9480b6fe4513`), the system prompt explicitly instructs the AI: *"The filters you support are location, company name & size, company industry, job title, **gender**."*
*   **Violation:** Enabling **Gender** as a filtering criterion for recruitment is a direct violation of EU fundamental rights (non-discrimination) and the data governance requirements of the AI Act, which mandates distinct measures to prevent discriminatory biases. Automating the inclusion or exclusion of candidates based on sex is illegal in an employment context.

**B. Violation of Transparency and Disclosure (Article 50)**
*   **Finding:** The `Gmail` ActionNode (ID: `695f41b990cb9480b6fe451e`) has a configurable signature. While the default is "Sent via Lindy", the prompt instructs: *"Do not add any concluding remarks... This field is only meant to contain the body of the email."* and allows the user to define the body.
*   **Violation:** Art 50(4) requires that natural persons exposed to an AI system be informed that they are interacting with an AI, unless it is obvious. Cold-emailing candidates (who have not applied) using an AI agent to simulate a recruiter's personal outreach, without a mandatory, unalterable disclosure that the content was AI-generated, violates transparency obligations.

**C. High-Risk Data Governance (Article 10)**
*   **Finding:** The agent uses "People Data Labs" to fetch *personal* emails and mobile numbers ("recommended_personal_email", "mobile_phone").
*   **Violation:** The AI Act requires High-Risk systems to use training, validation, and testing data sets that meet quality criteria. Using third-party data brokers to process the personal contact details of individuals who have not consented to be in this recruitment process creates a high risk of non-compliance with GDPR (which interacts with AI Act compliance). The agent lacks any mechanism to verify the accuracy of this data before processing, a requirement for High-Risk systems to prevent unfair impact.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
To mitigate legal and practical risk, the following changes are required immediately:

1.  **Hard-Stop on Gender Filtering:** You must modify the prompt in the "Search for leads" node to strictly **remove "gender"** from the list of supported filters. The system should be instructed to ignore gender-related queries to prevent discriminatory hiring practices.
2.  **Mandatory Disclosure:** Enforce a non-removable footer in the email logic (Node `695f41b990cb9480b6fe451e`) stating "This email was generated by an automated recruiting assistant."
3.  **Human Oversight (Article 14):** While the email node currently has `requireConfirmation: "Always"`, you must ensure that this confirmation occurs **per candidate** or that a human creates the content template. The current "Loop" logic creates a risk of mass-spamming if the confirmation is batched, which constitutes a lack of effective human oversight.
4.  **GDPR/Privacy Check:** Consult your DPO regarding the use of "People Data Labs." Accessing personal (non-work) emails and mobile phones for cold recruitment is a high-severity GDPR violation in the EU, separate from but compounding the AI Act risk.

### 5. Compliance Rating
**NON-COMPLIANT**

**Reasoning:** The explicit inclusion of "Gender" as a filtering capability in a recruitment tool renders this agent fundamentally non-compliant with the EU AI Act's requirements on fundamental rights and non-discrimination. It cannot be deployed in the EU in its current state.
