ID: lead-outreacher-6971943a0197c79d295d27cb
Log file: None
Regulation: GLBA
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition and configuration, here is the compliance assessment regarding the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, "Lead Outreacher," functions as an automated Sales Development Representative (SDR). Its primary workflow is:
1.  **Ingestion:** It triggers when a new row is added to a specific Google Sheet (containing lead contact info).
2.  **Processing:** It utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate personalized cold-outreach emails.
3.  **Execution:** It sends a sequence of up to three emails via a connected Gmail account (`m@mftestco.com`) over a period of several days.
4.  **Logic:** It attempts to personalize content based on the lead's company and industry data and includes logic to cancel the sequence (timers) if a response is detected.

### 2. GLBA Applicability
**Verdict: Not Applicable**

**Reasoning:**
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act applies to financial institutions and the protection of "consumers"—defined specifically as individuals who obtain financial products or services primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.

This agent is explicitly configured for **Business-to-Business (B2B)** commercial outreach, not consumer financial services.
*   **Evidence in Configuration:** The instructions direct the agent to consider "position within the company" and "company size."
*   **Evidence in Templates:** The email templates in the `ActionNode` configurations explicitly state: *"I noticed that [Lead's Company] is focused on..."* and *"help businesses like yours."*
*   **Data Types:** The data processed (Business Name, Business Email, Industry Pain Points) constitutes commercial contact information, which does not qualify as Nonpublic Personal Information (NPI) under GLBA.

### 3. Specific GLBA Violations
**None Found.**

Because the agent processes commercial business data rather than consumer financial data, it does not trigger the Privacy Rule or Safeguards Rule under GLBA.

*Note on other risks:* While not a GLBA violation, this agent presents a high risk regarding **CAN-SPAM Act** (USA) and **GDPR/CCPA** (Europe/California) compliance. The agent is configured to send cold automated emails without a visible mechanism to check for an "Unsubscribe" link or an opt-out footer in the `body` field of the email configuration.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
**For GLBA:**
*   No remediation is required as the regulation does not apply to this agent's current function.

**General Security & Compliance Recommendations (Non-GLBA):**
*   **CAN-SPAM Compliance:** The email body prompt in the `ActionNode` explicitly says: *"Do not add any concluding remarks like... 'Sincerely'."* You must mandate the inclusion of a physical postal address and a clear opt-out/unsubscribe mechanism in every email sent by this agent to avoid regulatory fines outside of GLBA.
*   **Data Leakage:** Ensure the Google Sheet connected (`spreadsheetId: ...C8nqO5QW0srky...`) does not inadvertently contain consumer columns (e.g., SSNs or personal credit scores) mixed with the business data, as the AI has full read access to the triggered row.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**RATING: COMPLIANT**
*(Specific to GLBA standards only)*
