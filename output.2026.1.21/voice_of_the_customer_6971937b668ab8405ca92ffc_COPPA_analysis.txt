Agent: Voice of the Customer22 minutes ago
ID: voice-of-the-customer-6971937b668ab8405ca92ffc
Log file: None
Regulation: COPPA
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition (`[AGENT_DEFINITION]`) and the analysis of its configuration and logic, here is the security and compliance assessment regarding COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act).

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, titled "Voice of the Customer," is an automated meeting assistant designed for enterprise use. Its workflow is as follows:
1.  **Trigger:** Monitors a specific Google Calendar (`m@mftestco.com`) for event starts.
2.  **Capture:** Uses the `LindyMeeting` tool to join video conferences (Google Meet, Zoom, Teams) as a bot, recording video and transcribing audio.
3.  **Logic:** Evaluates if the meeting was a "Customer call."
4.  **Output:** If criteria are met, it uses the `Gmail` tool to send an email to a distribution list containing extracted quotes and insights from the call. (Note: The description mentions Slack, but the actual configuration executes a Gmail action).

### 2. COPPA Applicability
**Verdict: Not Applicable**

COPPA applies to operators of commercial websites and online services that are either:
1.  Directed to children under the age of 13.
2.  General audience services where the operator has "actual knowledge" that they are collecting personal information from a child under 13.

**Reasoning:**
*   **Target Audience:** The agent is explicitly configured for business-to-business (B2B) or general business contexts. The inputs include corporate calendars and the output is directed toward internal teams ("Voice of the Customer," "Customer Insights flow"). There are no indicators in the prompts, descriptions, or logic that suggest the agent is directed toward children (e.g., no keywords regarding schools, games, tutoring, or youth marketing).
*   **Nature of Service:** The agent is a general productivity tool. Under current FTC guidance, general audience services that do not target children are not liable under COPPA unless they possess specific, actual knowledge of child data collection.

### 3. Specific Violations of COPPA
**Verdict: None Found**

*   **No Child-Targeting Logic:** The `instructions` and `prompts` within the configuration focus exclusively on "customers," "products," and "competitors."
*   **No Age Gating Violations:** As a general audience business tool, the agent is not required to screen for age.
*   **Data Collection:** While the agent captures voice recordings (which are considered Personal Information under COPPA), there is no evidence in the configuration that this collection is intended for or directed at children.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
While the agent is COPPA compliant based on its definition, the following are best practices to maintain this status:

*   **Usage Policy (Operational Recommendation):** Ensure the internal user (`m@mftestco.com`) is instructed not to use this agent for meetings where the primary attendees are known to be children (e.g., if the enterprise pivots to market research on minors).
*   **Configuration Hygiene (Non-Compliance Note):** The agent description claims it sends messages to **Slack**, but the actual action node (`6971937b668ab8405ca93008`) is configured to send **Emails via Gmail**. While not a COPPA violation, this is a governance risk regarding data destination transparency. Update the description to match the actual behavior.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

The agent is designed for general business operations and does not trigger COPPA regulatory requirements based on the provided configuration.
