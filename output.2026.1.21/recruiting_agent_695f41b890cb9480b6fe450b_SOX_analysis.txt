Agent: Recruiting Agent13 days ago+2
ID: recruiting-agent-695f41b890cb9480b6fe450b
Log file: None
Regulation: SOX
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition and configuration, here is the assessment regarding Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) applicability and compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Recruiting Agent" functions as a Sales Development Representative (SDR) or Recruiting Assistant. Its primary workflows are:
*   **Data Sourcing:** Queries an external database (People Data Labs) to find contact information for individuals or companies based on criteria like job title, location, and industry.
*   **Data Organization:** Creates and populates Google Sheets with this contact data (leads/candidates).
*   **Outreach:** capable of sending mass or individual emails to these identified leads via a connected Gmail account.

### 2. SOX Applicability
**Verdict: NOT APPLICABLE**

**Reasoning:**
Sarbanes-Oxley (specifically Section 404) governs **Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR)**. It regulates systems that process, store, or transmit data that materially impacts the company's financial statements (e.g., General Ledger, Payroll, Revenue Recognition, Inventory, Accounts Payable/Receivable).

This agent is an **Operational Tool** for top-of-funnel Lead Generation and Recruiting.
*   **No Financial Impact:** It does not calculate revenue, process expenses, handle invoicing, or touch the General Ledger.
*   **No Financial Data Access:** It accesses public contact data (People Data Labs) and personal productivity tools (Gmail/Sheets), not financial ERPs (e.g., SAP, Oracle, NetSuite).
*   **No Materiality:** The data generated (lists of potential hires or sales prospects) allows for future operational activity but does not represent a financial transaction or a realized financial event that requires reporting.

### 3. Specific SOX Violations
**Findings: NONE**

As the agent falls outside the scope of Financial Reporting controls, there are no definitive SOX violations.

*   **Segregation of Duties (SoD):** Not applicable. The agent does not have the combined authority to initiate and approve financial transactions.
*   **Data Integrity (Financial):** Not applicable. The agent does not modify financial records.
*   **Change Management:** Not applicable.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
While there are no SOX remediations required, please note the following **Non-SOX** operational risks visible in the configuration:
*   **GDPR/CCPA/CAN-SPAM Risk:** The agent automates the collection of PII (emails, phone numbers) and automates cold outreach (`Gmail.send`). Ensure your legal team reviews the `PeopleDataLabs` usage and the cold-emailing scripts to ensure compliance with privacy and anti-spam laws, as the agent is configured to loop through lists and send emails automatically.
*   **Shadow IT/Data Leakage:** The agent creates new Google Sheets (`GoogleSheets.create`) and shares them. Ensure the connected Google Workspace account (`m@mftestco.com`) is governed by your organization's DLP (Data Loss Prevention) policies to prevent lead data from being shared externally.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**RATING: COMPLIANT (N/A)**

*The rating is "Compliant" strictly because SOX regulations do not apply to this specific agent's defined function and scope.*
