Log file: None
Regulation: PCI-DSS
============================================================

Based on the review of the [AGENT_DEFINITION] and the functional logic provided, here is the assessment regarding PCI-DSS compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Recruiting Agent" is designed to function as a Sales Development Representative (SDR) or Recruiter assistant. Its specific workflow involves:
*   **Lead Generation:** Accepting criteria from a user (e.g., "engineers at Microsoft") and querying the **People Data Labs** (PDL) API to retrieve professional data (names, emails, job titles, locations, social URLs).
*   **Data Storage:** creating and exporting this data into a **Google Sheet** via the user's connected Google account.
*   **Outreach:** Sending emails to these leads via **Gmail** if requested by the user.

### 2. PCI-DSS Applicability
**Verdict: Not Applicable**

PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) applies strictly to entities that store, process, or transmit **Cardholder Data (CHD)** (specifically Primary Account Numbers - PAN) and/or Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD).

*   **No Collection:** The agent's instructions, logic flow, and API schemas (People Data Labs) are strictly configured to collect **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** (e.g., `work_email`, `mobile_phone`, `job_title`), not financial data.
*   **No Processing:** There are no tools configured to process payments (e.g., Stripe, PayPal actions) or fields in the input/output schemas designed to ingest credit card numbers or CVV codes.
*   **No Transmission:** The data flow moves from People Data Labs -> Google Sheets -> Gmail. At no point does the defined logic attempt to move financial transaction data.

### 3. Specific Violations of PCI-DSS
**None Found.**

Because the agent does not interact with the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE), it cannot violate PCI-DSS requirements. The agent retrieves professional contact information, which falls under privacy regulations (GDPR/CCPA/CPRA) rather than payment security standards.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
No remediation is required regarding PCI-DSS.

*   *Note on General Security:* While not a PCI issue, ensure the Google Account connected (m@mftestco.com) has appropriate access controls, as the agent writes extensive PII (emails, phone numbers) to Google Sheets.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT** (PCI-DSS Not Applicable)
