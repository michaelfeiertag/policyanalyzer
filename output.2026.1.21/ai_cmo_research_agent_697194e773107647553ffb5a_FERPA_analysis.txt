Agent: AI CMO | Research Agent
ID: ai-cmo-research-agent-697194e773107647553ffb5a
Log file: None
Regulation: FERPA
============================================================

Based on the analysis of the [AGENT_DEFINITION] provided, here is the FERPA compliance assessment.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **AI CMO | Research Agent** is a marketing automation tool designed to generate business strategy and competitive intelligence. Its workflow operates as follows:
*   **Input:** Accepts a company website URL from the user.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Scrapes the provided website for content (mission, products, tone).
    *   Uses Perplexity (AI search) to identify competitors, conduct market research, and analyze industry trends.
    *   Uses LLMs (GPT-5, Sonar) to generate buyer personas, USPs (Unique Selling Propositions), and customer journey maps.
*   **Output:** Creates multiple Google Docs in the user's connected Google Drive containing these reports (Competitor Analysis, Customer Profiles, Brand Guidelines, etc.).

### 2. FERPA Applicability
**FERPA is NOT applicable to this agent.**

**Reasoning:**
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects the privacy of **student education records** (grades, transcripts, disciplinary records, class schedules) maintained by educational institutions.

This agent is strictly designed for **Commercial and Market Intelligence**.
*   **Data Source:** The agent operates exclusively on **publicly available web data** (via URL scraping and Perplexity search) and user-provided business names.
*   **Data Type:** The agent processes business logic, marketing copy, and competitive landscape data. It does not ingest, process, store, or output Personally Identifiable Information (PII) regarding students or academic records.

Even if this agent were used by a University Marketing Department to analyze the University's own website, it interacts only with public-facing web content ("Directory Information" or public marketing copy), not the private student records protected under 20 U.S.C. § 1232g.

### 3. Specific Violations
**No FERPA violations found.**

*   The agent’s logic flows (loops for competitor analysis, Google Doc creation) utilize external AI models (Perplexity, OpenAI) to process public business information.
*   There are no integration points with Student Information Systems (SIS) or Learning Management Systems (LMS).
*   The "Google Docs" action creates files in the user's drive based on *marketing* prompts, not student data.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
No remediation is required regarding FERPA.

*   **Operational Note:** While FERPA is not a concern, ensure the Google Drive connection is authorized only for the specific user running the agent (OAuth is already correctly configured in the `auth` blocks of the JSON) to prevent general data leakage of the generated proprietary marketing strategy.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

*The agent operates entirely outside the scope of student education records and presents no FERPA-related regulatory risk.*
