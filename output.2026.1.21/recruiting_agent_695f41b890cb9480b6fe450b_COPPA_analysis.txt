Agent: Recruiting Agent13 days ago+2
ID: recruiting-agent-695f41b890cb9480b6fe450b
Log file: None
Regulation: COPPA
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition and log context, here is the COPPA compliance assessment.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Recruiting Agent" functions as an automated Sales Development Representative (SDR) or Recruiter. Its primary purpose is to identify professional candidates.
*   **Inputs:** It accepts criteria from the user (e.g., "4 engineers at Microsoft," "medical tech companies").
*   **Processing:** It queries the **People Data Labs** API to retrieve professional profiles (names, emails, LinkedIn URLs, job titles) and creates **Google Sheets** to organize this data.
*   **Outputs:** It provides markdown tables of leads to the user and can automate outreach by drafting and sending emails via **Gmail**.

### 2. COPPA Applicability
**COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) is NOT applicable to this agent.**

*   **Target Audience:** The agent is explicitly designed for professional business use (recruiting and sales). The definition describes it as a tool to "find and organize leads." The conversation starters ("engineers working at Microsoft") target adult professionals and enterprise users. It is not "directed to children" under 13.
*   **Data Source:** The agent pulls data from "People Data Labs," a B2B intelligence provider focused on professional workforce data, not children's data.
*   **User Interaction:** The agent interacts with an enterprise user (the compliance officer's employee). There is no mechanism or intent to interact with, solicit, or collect personal information directly from children under 13.

### 3. Specific Violations
**No violations found.**

Since the agent is a commercial recruiting tool and does not target children or knowingly collect data from children, it does not trigger COPPA requirements. There are no features in the `stateGraph`, `instructions`, or `actionConfiguration` that suggest the collection of data from minors.

### 4. Remediation Recommendations
**None required.**

The agent operates outside the scope of COPPA. No changes are necessary regarding children's privacy regulations.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant** (COPPA is Not Applicable)
