Agent: Board meeting monitorAbout 10 hours ago
ID: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
Log file: None
Regulation: CPRA
============================================================

Based on the provided `[AGENT_DEFINITION]`, here is the security and compliance assessment regarding CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act).

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, "Board meeting monitor," runs on a recurring schedule twice daily (9:00 AM and 6:00 PM). It queries a corporate Google Calendar for events matching "Board meetings" scheduled for the following day.
*   **Morning Logic:** If it is morning, it sends an email summary to `m@testco.com` via Gmail.
*   **Afternoon Logic:** If it is afternoon, it sends an SMS summary to `+14155312776` via Twilio.

### 2. CPRA Applicability
**Applicable: YES**

*   **Employee Data is Consumer Data:** As of January 1, 2023, the CPRA exemptions for employment-related data and B2B data have expired. Data relating to employees (internal identifiers, email addresses, schedules, and names) is protected under CPRA.
*   **Processing of PII:** The agent accesses Google Calendar events. The schema for these events includes `attendees` (containing names and email addresses), `organizer` (name and email), and `description` (potential unstructure PII). This constitutes "processing" of Personal Information (PI).

### 3. Specific CPRA Violations
Based on the definition provided, the agent introduces definitive compliance risks that constitute violations of CPRA principles regarding Data Minimization and Reasonable Security.

**A. Violation of Data Minimization (Civil Code § 1798.100(c))**
*   **The Issue:** The agent is configured to retrieve up to `250` events (`maxResults: 250`) and ingests the full event schema. This schema includes the full list of attendees (names and emails), descriptions, and attachments.
*   **The Violation:** CPRA requires that collection and processing be "reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purposes for which the personal information was collected." To simply notify a user that a board meeting exists or to state its start time, it is *not* necessary to process the PII of every attendee or the full body description of 250 calendar events. The agent is over-collecting PII relative to its stated function.

**B. Violation of Duty to Implement Reasonable Security (Civil Code § 1798.100(e))**
*   **The Issue:** The destination phone number (`+14155312776`) is hardcoded directly into the agent's Action Logic (`693b38d0bd61ebac9988a2ee`).
*   **The Violation:** Hardcoding a destination endpoint for sensitive corporate data (Board meeting schedules and attendee lists) constitutes a failure to implement reasonable security procedures.
    *   If this number belongs to a personal device (BYOD), a contractor, or is reassigned, the organization loses control over the PII sent to that device.
    *   There is no authentication check to ensure the recipient of the SMS is currently authorized to view Board attendance data at the time of transmission.
    *   This creates a high risk of unauthorized disclosure, which CPRA explicitly mandates businesses to prevent.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
To mitigate these risks and bring the agent into compliance:

1.  **Enforce Field Masking (Minimization):** Modify the `listEvents` action to explicitly request only the fields required for the notification (e.g., `summary`, `start.dateTime`, `location`). Exclude `attendees`, `description`, and `attachments` to prevent the unnecessary processing of PII.
2.  **Remove Hardcoded Endpoints:** Replace the hardcoded phone number and email address with a dynamic lookup against a secured Identity Provider (IdP) or an enterprise user directory. Ensure the recipient is verified as an active employee with appropriate clearance before the message is sent.
3.  **Implement Retention Policy:** Ensure the logs generated by this agent (which currently contain the full dump of calendar data) are subject to a strict retention schedule (e.g., delete after 7 days) to comply with Storage Limitation requirements.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Rating: Non-Compliant**

The agent automates the extraction of sensitive internal data (Board meeting attendees) and transmits it to a hardcoded, unverified external phone number without data filtering. This presents a significant practical risk of data leakage and violates the core CPRA tenets of Minimization and Security.
