Agent: Lindy Agent ListerAbout 8 hours ago+2
ID: lindy-agent-lister-693c78bb39099082df392692
Log file: None
Regulation: EU-AI-Act
============================================================

Based on the `[AGENT_DEFINITION]` provided, here is the regulatory and compliance assessment regarding the EU AI Act.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **Lindy Agent Lister** is an administrative automation tool designed to inventory software assets. Its specific workflow is:
1.  **Trigger:** It wakes up on a recurring hourly schedule (`0 * * * *`).
2.  **Data Retrieval:** It accesses the Lindy API (`Get tasks list`) to retrieve metadata about all other agents in the workspace (specifically: Agent ID, Agent Name, and Last Task Date).
3.  **Data Processing:** It iterates through this list using a control flow loop.
4.  **Data Storage:** It connects to an external Google Sheet ("Lindy Agents") via OAuth and performs an "upsert" (update or insert) operation to log the agent details into the spreadsheet.

### 2. EU AI Act Applicability
**Applicable: Yes (as a Minimal Risk System)**

The EU AI Act applies to this agent because it meets the definition of an AI system (using an LLM/inference model to interpret instructions and execute logic). However, the *obligations* under the Act depend on the risk classification.

*   **Classification:** This agent falls under **Minimal Risk**.
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   **Not Prohibited (Art. 5):** It does not deploy subliminal techniques, social scoring, or biometric identification.
    *   **Not High-Risk (Art. 6 & Annex III):** It does not make decisions regarding critical infrastructure, education, employment, credit scoring, law enforcement, or migration. While it logs "Last Task Date," this is standard IT asset management/logging, not the "AI-based monitoring of employee performance or behavior" targeted by Annex III.
    *   **Not Limited Risk (Art. 50):** While it has a tool to "Send message," its primary function is background data synchronization. It does not generate content (deep fakes) or act as a customer-facing chatbot requiring transparency disclosures in this context.

### 3. Specific Violations of EU AI Act
**Finding: No Violations Found**

Based on the definition provided, the agent acts as a standard IT automation script (Cron job) utilizing AI for orchestration. It does not violate the provisions of the EU AI Act.

*   **No Prohibited Practices:** The agent performs data entry tasks.
*   **No High-Risk Non-Compliance:** As a minimal risk system, it is exempt from the conformity assessments, data governance, and registration requirements applicable to high-risk systems.
*   **Transparency:** The agent identifies itself clearly in its configuration and output destination (Google Sheets).

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
Since the agent is compliant, no remediation is required for EU AI Act alignment. However, from a general security/compliance hygiene perspective (outside the strict scope of the AI Act), the following standard practices apply:

*   **Access Control:** Ensure the Google Sheet ("Lindy Agents") has restricted access permissions, as it contains metadata about your organization's AI deployment.
*   **Scope Verification:** Verify that the "Agent Name" fields being pulled do not inadvertently contain sensitive Personal Identifiable Information (PII) or confidential project codenames, as these are being exported to an external spreadsheet.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Rating: Compliant**

The agent is a low-risk administrative utility. It presents no "definitive, significant violations" or practical regulatory risk under the EU AI Act.
