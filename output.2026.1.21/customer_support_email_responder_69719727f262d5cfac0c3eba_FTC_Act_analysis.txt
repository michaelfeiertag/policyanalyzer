Agent: Customer Support Email Responder
ID: customer-support-email-responder-69719727f262d5cfac0c3eba
Log file: None
Regulation: FTC-Act
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition, here is the assessment regarding the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act).

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **Customer Support Email Responder** is an automated workflow designed to monitor a Gmail inbox for incoming customer service inquiries. Upon receiving an email, it searches a defined Knowledge Base for relevant information.
*   **If information is found:** It utilizes a Large Language Model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to draft a reply to the customer, adhering to a polite persona and strictly grounding answers in the Knowledge Base.
*   **If information is not found:** The logic implies it stops or alerts a human (as referenced in the greeting, though the specific Slack node is not detailed in the provided JSON edges).
*   **Key Configuration:** The agent is currently configured to **save replies as drafts** (`"saveAsDraft": true`) rather than sending them automatically.

### 2. FTC Act Applicability
**Yes, the FTC Act is applicable.**
The FTC Act (Section 5) prohibits "unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce." This applies to this agent because:
1.  **Commercial Interaction:** The agent is drafting responses to consumers regarding business inquiries, which constitutes "commerce."
2.  **AI Intermediary:** The FTC has explicitly stated that the use of AI tools to interact with consumers falls under their jurisdiction, specifically regarding **Impersonation** (making consumers believe they are talking to a human) and **Substantiation** (providing false or misleading information about products/services due to AI hallucinations).

### 3. FTC Act Violations
**No definitive violations found.**

While the FTC Act applies to the governance of this agent, the specific configuration provided in the [AGENT_DEFINITION] prevents it from violating the Act.

*   **No Deception (Impersonation):** The agent is configured with `"saveAsDraft": true`. This means the agent creates a draft that a human employee must review and manually send. Because a human is the final gatekeeper, the organization is not autonomously impersonating a human via AI; the human is using an AI tool to assist in their job.
*   **No Unfairness (Hallucination):** The prompt instructions explicitly state: *"Only answer via knowledge that you found in your knowledge base."* This "grounding" instruction minimizes the risk of the AI fabricating policies or promises (hallucinations) that could cause consumer injury.
*   **Disclosure:** The agent is configured to append a signature: *"Sent via [Lindy]"*. Even if the agent were set to auto-send, this disclosure likely satisfies the FTC's requirement to not mislead consumers about the use of automated tools, although "AI Support Agent" would be clearer.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
Although the agent is currently compliant, the following operational controls are recommended to maintain compliance if configurations change:

1.  **Maintain "Save as Draft" for High-Stakes Queries:** Do not change the `"saveAsDraft"` setting to `false` without implementing a secondary validation layer, especially if the Knowledge Base contains sensitive policy information (refunds, billing).
2.  **Enhance Disclosure (Conditional):** If you intend to switch this agent to **auto-send** (removing the human review), you should update the `sig` (signature) field to be more explicit. Change *"Sent via Lindy"* to *"Generated by AI Customer Support - Sent via Lindy"*. The FTC views ambiguous disclosures as potential deception if the consumer cannot tell they are interacting with a machine.
3.  **Audit Knowledge Base:** The agent relies 100% on the Knowledge Base. Ensure the documents in the KB are accurate and up-to-date. If the KB contains outdated policies, the agent will draft "deceptive" responses, for which the company is liable.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

*The agent creates drafts for human review rather than engaging in autonomous, unmonitored communication with consumers. This "Human-in-the-Loop" design effectively mitigates FTC risks regarding deception and unfairness.*
