Agent: Board meeting monitorAbout 10 hours ago
ID: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
Log file: None
Regulation: ECPA
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition, here is the assessment regarding the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA).

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, "Board meeting monitor," is an automated workflow designed to monitor a specific user's Google Calendar for upcoming board meetings. Its workflow is as follows:
*   **Triggers:** Runs twice daily on a recurring schedule (9:00 AM and 6:00 PM).
*   **Data Access:** Queries the connected Google Calendar (`m@mftestco.com`) for events matching the query "board meetings" occurring the next day.
*   **Logic:**
    *   **Morning Run:** Sends an email summary to `m@testco.com` using the user's Gmail account.
    *   **Evening Run:** Sends an SMS notification to `+14155312776` from `+15103453222` using a configured Twilio account.

### 2. ECPA Applicability
**Yes, ECPA is applicable.**
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-2523) governs the interception of electronic communications (Title I) and unauthorized access to stored electronic communications (Title II, the Stored Communications Act).
*   The agent accesses **stored electronic communications** (calendar entries and potential email data via the Gmail API).
*   The agent facilitates **electronic transmission** of data (sending emails and SMS).
*   Therefore, the agent operates within the domain regulated by ECPA.

### 3. Violation Assessment
**Does the agent violate ECPA? No.**

There are **no definitive violations** of ECPA in this agent configuration.

*   **Authorization (The "Consent" Exception):** ECPA and the Stored Communications Act (SCA) primarily prohibit *unauthorized* access or interception. The definition shows that the agent operates using authenticated credentials:
    *   **Google Auth:** The agent creates a connection using OAuth 2.0 (`isConnected: true`) with a specific identity (`m@mftestco.com`). By authenticating, the user has explicitly authorized the agent to access their stored communications (Calendar/Gmail).
    *   **Twilio Auth:** The agent uses explicit Account SID and Auth Tokens provided by the user to send SMS.
*   **No Interception:** The agent queries data at rest via official APIs (Google Calendar API); it does not intercept data in transit (wiretapping) from third parties without consent.
*   **User-Agent Relationship:** The agent acts as a proxy for the user (`m@mftestco.com`). It accesses data the user already has rights to view and sends messages the user has rights to send.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
While the agent is **ECPA compliant**, it presents **significant security governance risks** (Principle of Least Privilege) that you should address as a security officer:

1.  **Scope Minimization (Critical Risk):**
    *   The agent's Google OAuth token is granted extremely broad permissions that are unused by the logic.
    *   **Current Scopes:** Includes `drive` (read/write all files), `spreadsheets`, `documents`, and `gmail.readonly` (read all emails).
    *   **Actual Usage:** The agent only uses `calendar.readonly` (to check meetings) and `gmail.send` (to send the notification).
    *   **Recommendation:** Revoke the current token and re-authenticate the agent requesting *only* `calendar.events.readonly` and `gmail.send`. The current configuration exposes the organization to unnecessary data exfiltration risk if the agent or token is compromised.

2.  **Hardcoded Personal Identifiable Information (PII):**
    *   The target phone number (`+1415...`) and email (`m@testco.com`) are hardcoded in the agent definition.
    *   **Recommendation:** Move these values to input variables or environment secrets. If this agent is shared or templated, this hardcoded data will leak to other users.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating

**COMPLIANCE RATING: COMPLIANT**

*The agent does not violate ECPA because it operates with explicit user authorization and credentials. However, the over-privileged OAuth scopes represent a significant internal security policy risk.*
