Agent: Resume Screening Agent
ID: resume-screening-agent-6971956bbddcdd1d54fd8975
Log file: None
Regulation: EU-AI-Act
============================================================

Based on the review of the [AGENT_DEFINITION] provided, here is the compliance assessment regarding the EU AI Act.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **Resume Screening Agent** is an automated recruitment workflow designed to filter job applications. Its specific process is:
1.  **Ingestion:** It monitors a Gmail inbox for incoming emails containing resume attachments.
2.  **Analysis:** It retrieves the relevant Job Description (via Google Docs).
3.  **Evaluation:** It uses an AI Large Language Model (GPT-4 Turbo) to compare the resume against the job description. It assigns a "matching score" and classifies the candidate into three categories: Approved, Unqualified, or Partially Approved.
4.  **Output:** Based on the classification, it automatically generates and sends an email to the Hiring Manager (the user) summarizing the candidate's pros/cons and recommending the next step (e.g., "recommended for the next stage" or "does not qualify").

### 2. EU AI Act Applicability
**Applicability:** **YES**
**Classification:** **High-Risk AI System**

**Reasoning:**
Under the EU AI Act, AI systems are classified based on the risk they pose to fundamental rights. This agent falls squarely under **Annex III, Paragraph 4(a): Employment, workers management and access to self-employment.**

Specifically, the Act designates systems intended to be used for the **"recruitment or selection of natural persons, notably for... analyzing and filtering job applications, and evaluating candidates"** as High-Risk.

Because this agent autonomously analyzes resumes and filters them into "Approved" or "Unqualified" lists, it is subject to the strict compliance obligations of Articles 8–15 of the EU AI Act.

### 3. Specific Violations of EU AI Act
Based on the provided configuration, the following definitive violations and risks are identified:

*   **Violation of Article 14 (Human Oversight):**
    *   **Evidence:** In the agent configuration, the Action Nodes for sending emails (Nodes `...983`, `...984`, `...985`) have the property `"requireConfirmation": "Never"`.
    *   **Risk:** The system performs the evaluation and finalizing action (sending the verdict to the hiring manager) without a forced "human-in-the-loop" to verify the AI's judgment. While the email goes to the manager, the lack of an intermediate validation step creates "automation bias," where the manager is likely to accept the AI's "Unqualified" label without reviewing the underlying resume, effectively delegating the rejection decision to the AI.

*   **Violation of Article 10 (Data Governance & Bias Mitigation):**
    *   **Evidence:** The AI prompt instructions are generic ("You are a resume screening bot...").
    *   **Risk:** High-Risk systems require strict data governance to prevent discriminatory outcomes (e.g., penalizing gaps in employment, gender-biased language, or formatting differences). There are no guardrails in the prompt or logic to prevent the model from hallucinating qualifications or exhibiting bias against protected groups.

*   **Violation of Article 11 (Technical Documentation & Record Keeping):**
    *   **Evidence:** The workflow logic is simplistic (`if match -> send email`).
    *   **Risk:** The system does not appear to generate a durable, auditable log of *why* a specific decision was reached (e.g., storing the reasoning in a database) other than a transient email. In the event of a dispute (a candidate claiming discrimination), the organization cannot easily reconstruct the specific logic path or "score" generation for audit purposes.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
To bring this agent into compliance, the following changes are mandatory:

1.  **Mandate Human Oversight (Critical):**
    *   Change the configuration for all Email Action Nodes from `"requireConfirmation": "Never"` to **"Always"**.
    *   Alternatively, change the action from "Send Email" to "Create Draft." The Human Hiring Manager *must* actively review and click a button/send the draft to confirm they agree with the AI's assessment.

2.  **Implement Logging (Record Keeping):**
    *   Add a step to save the AI's analysis (the "score," "pros," and "cons") to a persistent record (e.g., a Google Sheet or ATS system) *before* sending the email. This creates the audit trail required by Article 12.

3.  **Enhance System Prompts (Bias Mitigation):**
    *   Update the system instructions to explicitly forbid evaluation based on age, gender, origin, or other protected characteristics.
    *   Include a disclaimer in the generated email to the Hiring Manager stating: *"This assessment was generated by AI and must be verified by a human recruiter."*

4.  **Transparency Notice:**
    *   Ensure that the job application portal (where the candidate submits the resume) creates a disclosure (per Article 13) informing the candidate that AI is used to assist in the screening process.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Rating:** **Non-Compliant**

**Conclusion:** This agent is a **High-Risk AI System** currently configured to operate with full autonomy (`requireConfirmation: "Never"`) on a sensitive employment task. Deploying this agent in its current state within the EU (or processing EU citizen data) poses a significant regulatory risk. It must not be deployed until Human Oversight mechanisms are enforced.
