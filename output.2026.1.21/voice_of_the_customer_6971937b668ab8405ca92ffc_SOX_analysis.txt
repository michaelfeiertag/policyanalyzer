Agent: Voice of the Customer22 minutes ago
ID: voice-of-the-customer-6971937b668ab8405ca92ffc
Log file: None
Regulation: SOX
============================================================

Based on the review of the provided [AGENT_DEFINITION], here is the assessment regarding Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, titled "Voice of the Customer," monitors the Google Calendar of a specific user (`m@mftestco.com`). When a meeting starts, the agent joins via the "Lindy meeting recorder," records the audio, and generates a transcript. It then evaluates if the meeting was a "Customer call." If yes, it extracts noteworthy quotes regarding product feedback (likes, dislikes, competitor comparisons) and sends these quotes via **Gmail** to a distribution list (likely a team).

*Note: There is a configuration mismatch. The agent description claims it sends quotes to **Slack**, but the actual logic node is configured to send emails via **Gmail**.*

### 2. SOX Applicability
**Determination: NOT APPLICABLE**

**Reasoning:**
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) specifically mandates the accuracy of financial reporting, the integrity of financial data, and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR).
*   **Nature of Data:** This agent processes qualitative product sentiment and marketing feedback ("Voice of the Customer"). It does not process, store, or modify quantitative financial data, general ledgers, revenue recognition, payroll, or financial statements.
*   **System Impact:** The agent does not interact with ERPs (e.g., SAP, Oracle) or financial databases. It operates on Calendar, Meeting Audio, and Email.
*   **Risk Profile:** While the agent records calls, the resulting data (product quotes) is not material to the financial assertions of the company.

### 3. Specific Violations
**None.**

Since the agent is outside the scope of financial reporting systems, it does not violate SOX regulations.

*Observation on Data Integrity (Non-SOX):*
While not a SOX violation, the prompt instruction in the Gmail action explicitly tells the AI: *"feel free to slightly change it from what the person exactly said in order to make it more readable."* From a general compliance and data integrity standpoint, instructing an AI to alter direct quotes is a risky practice, but it does not constitute a federal securities law violation in this context.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
*   **N/A** for SOX compliance.
*   *Operational Recommendation:* Update the Agent Description to reflect that it sends emails (Gmail), not Slack messages, to ensure the documentation matches the monitoring capabilities.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT** (Not Applicable)
