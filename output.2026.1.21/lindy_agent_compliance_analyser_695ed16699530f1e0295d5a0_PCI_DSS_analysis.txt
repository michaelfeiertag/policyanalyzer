Agent: Lindy Agent Compliance Analyser14 days ago+2
ID: lindy-agent-compliance-analyser-695ed16699530f1e0295d5a0
Log file: None
Regulation: PCI-DSS
============================================================

Based on the review of the provided agent definition (`lindy-agent-compliance-analyser-695ed16699530f1e0295d5a0`), here is the assessment regarding PCI-DSS compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent is designed to iterate through a list of other agents in the workspace. For each agent found, it executes a JavaScript snippet to generate a Base64 ID and subsequently sends a raw **HTTP POST** request to a GraphQL endpoint. This request fetches detailed metadata about the workspace and agents, including configuration settings, identity information, and **billing summaries** (specifically credit allocation, plan types, and trial info).

### 2. PCI-DSS Applicability
**Applicability:** **NO**

**Reasoning:**
PCI-DSS applies only to system components that store, process, or transmit Cardholder Data (CHD), specifically Primary Account Numbers (PAN) or Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD).

An analysis of the GraphQL query embedded in the HTTP Action node (`695ed263d30659e475b9b9db`) reveals that while the agent requests `billingInfo`, the specific fields requested are:
*   `subscriptionPlan { planType }`
*   `creditsInfo { percentConsumed, creditAllocation }`
*   `trialInfo { expiresAt }`

The agent **does not** query for, transmit, or process credit card numbers (PAN), CVV codes, or full payment method details. As the agent operates outside the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE), PCI-DSS regulations do not apply to this specific agent configuration.

### 3. Specific Violations (PCI-DSS)
**None.**
Since the agent does not handle Cardholder Data, it cannot violate PCI-DSS requirements regarding the protection of that data.

### 4. Recommendations
While there are no PCI-DSS violations, a **Critical General Security Vulnerability** was identified that requires immediate remediation:

*   **Remediation (Critical):** The HTTP Action node (`695ed263d30659e475b9b9db`) contains a **Hardcoded Session Cookie** in the header configuration (`lsid=s%3A9Qhv...`).
    *   **Risk:** This is a "Hardcoded Credential" vulnerability (CWE-798). It allows the agent to permanently impersonate the user "Michael Feiertag" (or the session owner). If this agent definition is shared or inspected, that user's session is compromised.
    *   **Fix:** Remove the hardcoded `Cookie` header. Configure the agent to use the platform's native authentication (e.g., passing the current user's bearer token dynamically) or a dedicated API Key/OAuth connection.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Rating:** **Compliant**
*(Note: This rating is specific to PCI-DSS scope. From a general cybersecurity perspective, the agent is High Risk due to the hardcoded session credentials.)*
