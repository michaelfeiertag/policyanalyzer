Agent: Voice of the Customer22 minutes ago
ID: voice-of-the-customer-6971937b668ab8405ca92ffc
Log file: None
Regulation: NIST-AI-RMF
============================================================

Based on the provided `[AGENT_DEFINITION]`, here is the security and compliance assessment regarding the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF).

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, titled "Voice of the Customer," is an automated workflow designed to:
1.  **Monitor** a user's Google Calendar (`m@mftestco.com`) for upcoming events.
2.  **Auto-Join** video meetings (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams) using a bot named "Team's Lindy Assistant."
3.  **Record and Transcribe** the meeting audio.
4.  **Analyze** the transcript using an LLM (`claude3_5_sonnet`) to determine if it was a "customer call."
5.  **Extract and Modify** quotes from the transcript based on specific prompt instructions.
6.  **Distribute** these quotes via **Email (Gmail)** to a recipient list (note: The agent description incorrectly states it sends to Slack, but the logic node `6971937b668ab8405ca93008` is configured for Gmail).

### 2. NIST AI RMF Applicability
**Status: APPLICABLE**

The NIST AI RMF is applicable to this agent because:
*   **Generative AI Usage:** The agent utilizes a Large Language Model (`claude3_5_sonnet`) to interpret unstructured data (transcripts) and generate new content (summaries/quotes).
*   **High-Impact Decisions/Actions:** The agent has autonomous capabilities to record private conversations and disseminate information to third parties (via email) without forced human intervention.
*   **Privacy Implications:** The system processes Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and potentially sensitive business intelligence (customer voice data), falling under the "Map" and "Manage" functions of the framework regarding privacy and reliability.

### 3. Specific Violations of NIST AI RMF
The following are definitive, significant violations found in the configuration that present practical risk:

**A. Violation of Human Oversight (NIST RMF: MANAGE 2.5)**
*   **Observation:** The Final Action Node (Gmail) is configured with `"saveAsDraft": false` and `"requireConfirmation": "Never"`.
*   **Violation:** The agent autonomously generates an email containing extracted quotes and sends it immediately. There is no "Human-in-the-Loop" (HITL) to verify the accuracy of the quotes or the propriety of sending the email before it leaves the user's outbox.
*   **Risk:** Data leakage or reputational damage if the AI hallucinates, insults the customer, or shares confidential information.

**B. Violation of Reliability and Accuracy (NIST RMF: MAP 2.2)**
*   **Observation:** The prompt in the Action Node explicitly instructs the AI: *"feel free to slightly change it from what the person exactly said... removing repeated words or grammar mistakes."*
*   **Violation:** While intended for readability, explicitly instructing an LLM to alter direct quotes violates the integrity of data labeled as "Voice of the Customer." This creates a "Fabricated Evidence" risk where the agent attributes words to a customer that they did not say.
*   **Risk:** Inaccurate compliance records or misleading business intelligence.

**C. Violation of Privacy & Consent (NIST RMF: GOVERN 1.2 / MAP 1.5)**
*   **Observation:** The Entry Point Trigger is configured with `"attendeeTypeFilter": "all"`.
*   **Violation:** The agent will attempt to join and record *any* meeting on the calendar, including sensitive internal meetings (HR, Legal) or external meetings where recording consent has not been granted.
*   **Risk:** Violation of wiretapping laws (e.g., Two-Party Consent states) and GDPR/CCPA privacy requirements.

**D. Violation of Least Privilege / Data Minimization (NIST RMF: MANAGE 1.3)**
*   **Observation:** The Authentication configuration (`693b2e84e6a088955f32f886`) requests the following scopes:
    *   `.../auth/documents` (Google Docs)
    *   `.../auth/drive` (Google Drive Full Access)
    *   `.../auth/spreadsheets` (Google Sheets)
*   **Violation:** The agent logic *only* utilizes Calendar and Gmail capabilities. Requesting full Read/Write access to the user's entire Drive, Docs, and Sheets is a massive violation of the Principle of Least Privilege.
*   **Risk:** If this agent's token is compromised, the attacker gains full access to the organization's file storage, not just the meeting data.

**E. Violation of Transparency (NIST RMF: GOVERN 4.2)**
*   **Observation:** The `description` field states: *"...sends the noteworthy quotes to your team on Slack"*. However, the actual implementation uses the `Gmail` tool.
*   **Violation:** The system description misleads the user regarding where data is being sent.
*   **Risk:** Users may authorize the agent believing data remains in internal Slack channels, unaware it is being emailed (potentially to external addresses, as the `to` field is not fixed).

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation

1.  **Implement Human-in-the-Loop:** Change the Gmail Action configuration to `"saveAsDraft": true` or set `"requireConfirmation": "Always"`. This ensures a human reviews the AI-generated quotes before distribution.
2.  **Enforce Verbatim Accuracy:** Modify the prompt to remove permission to change quotes. Use a prompt such as: *"Extract quotes exactly as spoken. Do not correct grammar. If a quote is unclear, do not include it."*
3.  **Restrict Recording Scope:** Change the Trigger `attendeeTypeFilter` to "internal" or implement a strict allow-list logic node to prevent recording unauthorized external or sensitive internal meetings.
4.  **Scope Reduction:** Re-authenticate the agent requesting *only* `calendar.events`, `calendar.readonly`, `gmail.send`, and `gmail.compose` scopes. Remove Drive, Docs, and Sheets permissions.
5.  **Fix Documentation:** Update the agent name and description to accurately reflect that it sends **Emails**, not Slack messages.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating

**NON-COMPLIANT**

The agent demonstrates critical failures in privacy configuration (indiscriminate recording), data integrity (instructed alteration of quotes), security (excessive permissions), and oversight (no human review). It should not be deployed in an enterprise environment in its current state.
