Agent: Personal Computer Assistant
ID: personal-computer-assistant-697194cf64cff41a8f386a07
Log file: None
Regulation: DORA
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition and your role as a Security and Compliance Officer at a large enterprise, here is the assessment regarding the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).

**Note on Material:** The input provided contained the `[AGENT_DEFINITION]` but did not contain the `[SAMPLE_LOG]`. This assessment is based strictly on the configuration and intent declared in the agent's definition file.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **Personal Computer Assistant** is a general-purpose automation agent designed to control a computer interface (specifically a "Lindy Computer" sandbox). It is configured to accept natural language commands to execute tasks via a web browser.

Crucially, the agent advertises the following capabilities via its "Conversation Starters":
*   **Financial Access:** "Check my credit card statement"
*   **Healthcare Access:** "Find a doctor in network"
*   **Transactional Actions:** "Buy groceries," "Make a restaurant reservation."

It functions by initiating a remote computing session (`Start Computer Session`) and utilizing a browser tool to navigate the web, presumably mimicking human interaction (screen control/browser automation) rather than using authenticated, secure APIs.

### 2. DORA Applicability
**Status: APPLICABLE**

DORA is applicable to this agent if your enterprise is a Financial Entity (FE) or if this agent is being assessed for use within a workflow that touches financial data or critical ICT systems.

*   **Critical Functionality:** The agent explicitly invites users to **"Check my credit card statement."** This brings the agent directly into the scope of "Critical or Important Functions" (CIF) regarding the access and display of sensitive financial data.
*   **ICT Third-Party Risk:** This agent relies on an external infrastructure (`LindyComputer`, likely a cloud-hosted sandbox). Under DORA, your enterprise is responsible for managing the risk of this third-party dependency.
*   **Data Integrity & Confidentiality:** DORA mandates strict protocols for the handling of ICT data. An agent capable of viewing and processing banking statements falls under these strictures.

### 3. Specific Violations of DORA
Based on the `[AGENT_DEFINITION]`, the following are **definitive violations** of DORA principles regarding ICT Risk Management and Operational Resilience.

**A. Violation of Access Control and Identity Management (Article 9)**
*   **The Issue:** The `ActionNode` configuration explicitly sets `requireConfirmation: "Never"`.
*   **The Violation:** The agent is authorized to initiate computer sessions and potentially navigate to banking portals without human-in-the-loop confirmation. DORA requires that access rights and credentials for ICT assets (like banking portals) are strictly managed. Allowing an AI agent autonomous, unconfirmed control over a browser intended to access "Credit Card Statements" violates the principle of Least Privilege and sound access management.

**B. Violation of ICT Security and Data Integrity (Article 9 & Article 5)**
*   **The Issue:** The agent uses a generic "Use browser" tool (`LindyComputer`) to access financial data (`Check my credit card statement`) rather than a dedicated, encrypted API (e.g., Open Banking protocols).
*   **The Violation:** Using visual browser automation (screen scraping or DOM manipulation) to access financial accounts introduces severe data leakage risks. The agent's memory or logs (which capture the browser session) would contain unmasked financial data. This violates the requirement to ensure the "availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of data."

**C. Violation of ICT Third-Party Risk Management (Article 28)**
*   **The Issue:** The definition shows `auth: null` for the computer session.
*   **The Violation:** This implies that authentication into third-party services (Instacart, Banks, etc.) is either handled manually by the user *inside* the agent's proxied environment, or credentials are passed continuously. This creates a "Shadow IT" environment where the enterprise cannot monitor or log the specific authentication events occurring inside the "Lindy Computer" sandbox. DORA requires the enterprise to fully monitor and control third-party risks; this "black box" execution model prevents compliance.

### 4. Remediation Recommendations
To mitigate these risks and move toward compliance:

1.  **Restrict Scope:** Immediately **remove** "Check my credit card statement" and "Find a doctor in network" from the `conversationStarters`. This agent must not be advertised or used for financial or PHI (Protected Health Information) data in its current configuration.
2.  **Enforce Human Oversight:** Change `requireConfirmation` from `"Never"` to `"Always"` for any action involving the `Start Computer Session` or external web navigation.
3.  **Implement Auth Controls:** Disable generic browser access for sensitive workflows. If financial data access is required, it must be done via a specific Action Node using an authorized API key, not a generic computer browser session.
4.  **Allow-Listing:** Configure the `LindyComputer` tool to restrict the browser to a specific allow-list of URLs (e.g., only Instacart or OpenTable) to prevent data exfiltration to unauthorized domains.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Rating: NON-COMPLIANT**

**Reasoning:** The agent is configured to bypass user confirmation (`requireConfirmation: "Never"`) while explicitly encouraging the access of highly regulated financial data ("Check my credit card statement") via a non-transparent, generic browser automation tool. This presents an unacceptable and unmanageable risk to data confidentiality and integrity under DORA.
