Agent: Resume Screening Agent
ID: resume-screening-agent-6971956bbddcdd1d54fd8975
Log file: None
Regulation: PCI-DSS
============================================================

Based on the review of the provided [AGENT_DEFINITION], here is the PCI-DSS compliance assessment.

**Note:** You referenced a [SAMPLE_LOG], but only the [AGENT_DEFINITION] JSON was provided. This assessment is based strictly on the logic, permissions, and configuration defined in the agent's code.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **Resume Screening Agent** is an HR automation tool designed to streamline the hiring process. Its workflow is as follows:
*   **Trigger:** It listens for incoming emails via Gmail.
*   **Input Processing:** It identifies emails containing resume attachments. It accesses Google Docs to retrieve a specific job description.
*   **Analysis:** It utilizes an AI model (GPT-4 Turbo) to compare the resume against the job description to determine if the candidate is "Qualified," "Unqualified," or "Borderline."
*   **Output:** It composes and sends an email (via Gmail) to the HR/Hiring Manager with a summary of the candidate's qualifications and a recommendation.

### 2. PCI-DSS Applicability
**Verdict: Not Applicable**

PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) applies solely to entities and systems that store, process, or transmit Cardholder Data (CHD) (e.g., Primary Account Numbers) or Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD).

*   **Nature of Data:** The data processed by this agent includes Personally Identifiable Information (PII) found in resumes (names, addresses, work history) and internal business data (job descriptions). It does not involve financial transactions, payment gateways, or credit card processing.
*   **Workflow:** The defined actions (reading Google Docs, analyzing text, sending emails) do not interact with payment infrastructure (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, banking APIs).
*   **No Solicitation:** The system instructions and prompts ("Qualified Candidate", "Upload your resume") are strictly related to recruitment and do not solicit payment information.

### 3. Specific Violations
**No PCI-DSS violations found.**

As the agent is not designed to handle payment data, it does not violate PCI-DSS requirements.

*   **Observation on Permissions:** While not a PCI violation, the agent holds broad OAuth scopes (e.g., `drive`, `gmail.modify`, `spreadsheets`). Unless your organization creates a specific violation by storing Credit Card numbers in the specific Google Drive/Sheets accessed by this agent (which itself would be a violation of PCI storage rules), this agent presents no PCI risk.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
Since PCI-DSS does not apply and no violations were found, no remediation is required for PCI compliance.

**General Security Recommendation (Non-PCI):**
While not related to credit cards, this agent processes PII (Resumes). Ensure this agent allows compliance with **GDPR/CCPA** (specifically the "Right to be Forgotten"). You should ensure that emails processed by this agent can be identified and deleted if a candidate requests data deletion, as the agent may save drafts or retain context in the model provider's logs depending on your enterprise settings.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant** (Status: Out of Scope)
