Agent: Customer Support Email Responder
ID: customer-support-email-responder-69719727f262d5cfac0c3eba
Log file: None
Regulation: PSD2
============================================================

Based on the review of the provided [AGENT_DEFINITION], here is the regulatory and compliance assessment regarding PSD2 (Revised Payment Services Directive).

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, titled "Customer Support Email Responder," is an automation workflow designed to handle customer service inquiries. Its specific operations are:
*   **Trigger:** Monitors a Gmail inbox for incoming messages (`onGmailMessageReceived`).
*   **Process:** Extracts the content of the email and performs a semantic search against a connected Knowledge Base (documents, files, etc.) to find relevant answers.
*   **Output:** If an answer is found, it uses a Large Language Model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to draft a reply email (`Gmail.SendToGmail`) using the information retrieved.
*   **Configuration:** The agent is currently configured to save these responses as **drafts** (`"saveAsDraft": true`), requiring human approval before sending.

### 2. PSD2 Applicability
**Verdict: PSD2 is NOT Applicable.**

**Reasoning:**
PSD2 (Directive (EU) 2015/2366) regulates **Payment Services** within the European Economic Area. It applies specifically to Payment Service Providers (PSPs), Account Information Service Providers (AISPs), and Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs).

To fall under the scope of PSD2, an agent must:
1.  Access "payment accounts" (e.g., bank accounts, credit card accounts) to aggregate data.
2.  Initiate payment transactions on behalf of a user.
3.  Issue payment instruments or acquire payment transactions.

This agent operates exclusively on **Communication (Gmail)** and **Information Retrieval (Knowledge Base)** APIs. It possesses OAuth scopes for Google Workspace (`gmail.readonly`, `drive.readonly`, `calendar.events`), but it lacks access to banking APIs, open banking interfaces, or financial transaction layers. It does not process payments, nor does it access financial account balances or transaction histories.

### 3. Specific Violations of PSD2
**None found.**

As the agent does not perform payment services, initiate fund transfers, or access payment account information, it cannot violate PSD2 provisions regarding Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), secure communication, or third-party access rights.

### 4. Remediation Recommendations
No remediation is required regarding PSD2.

*Note: While not related to PSD2, ensure the connected "Knowledge Base" does not inadvertently contain unmasked credit card numbers (PCI-DSS) or PII unrelated to the business context (GDPR), as the agent feeds this data into an LLM.*

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
*(The agent is outside the scope of PSD2 regulation.)*
