Regulation: FTC-Act
============================================================

Based on the review of the [AGENT_DEFINITION] provided, here is the compliance assessment regarding the **Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act)**.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, "Lead Outreacher," functions as an autonomous Sales Development Representative (SDR). It monitors a Google Sheet for new rows (leads), then executes a cold outreach campaign consisting of three sequential emails sent via Gmail. It includes "wait" periods (timers) of three days between emails. The agent uses Generative AI to write the subject lines and bodies of these emails based on specific templates provided in the system instructions.

### 2. FTC Act Applicability
**Yes, the FTC Act is applicable.**
The FTC Act (specifically Section 5) prohibits "unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce." This explicitly covers marketing, advertising, and sales outreach. Since this agent is automating commercial solicitation (B2B sales outreach) and making representations about business results to potential customers, it falls directly under the FTC's jurisdiction regarding truth-in-advertising and commercial communication standards.

### 3. Specific Violations Found
I have identified **two definitive violations** that present significant practical risk.

**A. Deceptive Marketing Practices (Fabricated Performance Claims)**
*   **Location:** `ActionNode` (Second outreach email), `text` field prompt.
*   **Violation:** The agent's prompt explicitly instructs the model to use a template containing a specific, unverified statistic: *"achieved a 30% increase on ROAS within 3 months."*
*   **Analysis:** Under the FTC Act, all objective claims (like "30% increase") must be substantiated by evidence *before* they are disseminated. By hardcoding a specific performance metric into the prompt template, the agent is instructed to send this claim to leads. Unless the user's product actually guarantees exactly a 30% ROAS increase for every lead, this constitutes the dissemination of a materially false or misleading claim. The AI is likely to output this number as a fact because it is explicitly in the instruction set.

**B. Violation of Commercial Email Requirements (CAN-SPAM/FTC Enforced)**
*   **Location:** All `ActionNode` email bodies (`First`, `Second`, and `Third` outreach).
*   **Violation:** The agent sends unsolicited commercial messages but fails to include the mandatory compliance elements required by law (enforced by the FTC).
*   **Analysis:** Commercial emails must include:
    1.  A valid physical postal address.
    2.  A clear and conspicuous explanation of how the recipient can opt out of getting email in the future (Unsubscribe).
    The agent's prompts explicitly command the AI: *"Do not add any concluding remarks... This field is only meant to contain the body of the email."* The `sig` (signature) field defaults to "Sent from [Lindy]", which does not meet the legal requirement for a physical address or opt-out mechanism. There is no logic in the agent to handle an "unsubscribe" request other than a generic reply check.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
To mitigate these risks, the following changes are required:

1.  **Sanitize Prompts of Specific Metrics:** Remove the "30% increase on ROAS" text from the `Second outreach email` prompt. Replace it with a placeholder that forces the AI to look for data or use a generic variable (e.g., *"[Insert User's specific Case Study Metric here]"*). The prompt should explicitly instruct the AI: *"Do not invent performance statistics. Only use metrics provided in the lead context or knowledge base."*
2.  **Hardcode Compliance Footers:** The `sig` (Signature) field in the Gmail action configuration must be updated to include a standard compliance footer.
    *   *Required Update:* Change default signature to:
        > Sent from Lindy
        > [Company Name]
        > [Physical Mailing Address]
        > To stop receiving these emails, please reply with "Unsubscribe".
3.  **Implement Opt-Out Logic:** Ensure the "Observe" edges (which currently look for *any* reply) specifically detect "stop" or "unsubscribe" keywords to permanently halt the flow, rather than just canceling the timer (which is the current behavior).

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Non-Compliant**

The agent is currently configured to generate deceptive performance claims and send commercial email that violates federal disclosure statutes. It should not be deployed in a production environment in its current state.
