Agent: Voice of the Customer22 minutes ago
ID: voice-of-the-customer-6971937b668ab8405ca92ffc
Log file: None
Regulation: DORA
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition and the context of the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), here is the assessment.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, titled "Voice of the Customer," is an automated workflow designed to join and record video meetings (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet) triggered by a Google Calendar event.
*   **Trigger:** Starts 1 minute before any calendar event (`onCalendarEventStart`).
*   **Process:** It records the meeting audio/video, transcribes it, and identifies if the meeting was a "Customer call."
*   **Output:** It utilizes an LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to extract "noteworthy quotes" regarding product feedback and competitors. It then automatically drafts and sends an **email via Gmail** to a distribution list with these quotes.
*   **Note:** There is a configuration discrepancy: The description claims it sends to Slack, but the actual configuration nodes (`6971937b668ab8405ca93008`) utilize the **Gmail** tool.

### 2. DORA Applicability
**Applicable: YES**

DORA (Regulation (EU) 2022/2554) is applicable if your "large enterprise" is a defined **Financial Entity** (e.g., bank, insurer, investment firm) or if this agent interacts with Critical ICT Third-Party Service Providers serving such an entity.

This agent falls under DORA scrutiny because:
1.  **Critical Data Handling:** It processes unstructured voice and video data from "Customer calls." In a financial context, client calls often contain sensitive PII, financial advice, or material non-public information.
2.  **ICT Risk Management (Art. 5-16):** The agent automates communication (Email) based on AI interpretation of data, which impacts the integrity and confidentiality of information assets.

### 3. Specific Violations of DORA
The following are definitive, non-speculative violations based on the JSON configuration provided:

**A. Violation of Data Integrity and Control (Article 9)**
*   **The Issue:** The Action Node for sending emails (`Gmail.send`) has `requireConfirmation: "Never"`.
*   **The Violation:** The agent uses an LLM to generate summaries and quotes ("slightly change it from what the person exactly said"). It then automatically disseminates this via email without human review. DORA Article 9 requires financial entities to ensure the **authenticity and integrity** of data. Allowing an AI to "slightly change" customer quotes and email them automatically creates a high risk of disseminating inaccurate financial data or misleading client statements, which constitutes a failure to implement appropriate data integrity controls.

**B. Violation of ICT Asset Management & Configuration (Article 8)**
*   **The Issue:** The Agent `description` states it sends quotes to **Slack**, but the logic flows to a **Gmail** action node.
*   **The Violation:** DORA Article 8 requires the identification, classification, and documentation of all ICT assets and functions. The discrepancy between the agent's documented purpose (Slack) and its actual execution (Gmail) represents a failure in configuration management. This prevents the security team from accurately mapping where data is exiting the environment.

**C. Violation of Data Availability and Recovery (Article 12)**
*   **The Issue:** The `LindyMeeting` tool description notes: *"Video recording URLs are valid for 24 hours... Upload ... for long-term storage."*
*   **The Violation:** The workflow has **no step** to save the video or transcript to persistent enterprise storage (e.g., Google Drive, SharePoint). The data is captured, processed, emailed, and then the source recording expires. DORA Article 12 requires policies to ensure the **availability** and restoration of data. By failing to archive the recording before the 24-hour expiration, the organization loses the audit trail required to verify the accuracy of the AI-generated quotes.

**D. Violation of Access Control / Least Privilege (Article 9)**
*   **The Issue:** The Entry Point trigger is configured with `attendeeTypeFilter: "all"`.
*   **The Violation:** The agent activates for *every* meeting on the calendar, records it, and *then* the Logic Node checks if it was a customer call. This means internal, confidential, or sensitive HR/Legal meetings are recorded and transcribed by a third-party processor (Lindy) before being filtered out. This violates the principle of least privilege and data minimization required under ICT risk management frameworks mandated by DORA.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
To bring this agent into compliance, the following actions are required:

1.  **Enforce Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** Change the `requireConfirmation` setting on the `Gmail.send` node from `"Never"` to `"Always"`. A human must verify the accuracy of the quotes and the recipients before the email is sent.
2.  **Implement Data Archival:** Add a new Action Node immediately after the recording finishes to upload the `videoUrl` and `transcript` to a sanctioned enterprise storage solution (e.g., Google Drive) to satisfy Data Availability and Audit requirements.
3.  **Refine Trigger Scope:** Modify the `EntryPointTriggerNode` to filter events *before* recording starts (e.g., only trigger if the event title contains "External" or "Client"). Recording all meetings and filtering later is a security breach.
4.  **Fix Configuration Documentation:** Update the agent description to accurately reflect that it sends emails via Gmail, not Slack.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**NON-COMPLIANT**

This agent introduces significant operational risk. It allows for the unverified modification and automatic dissemination of client statements and fails to retain audit trails (recordings) beyond 24 hours. It should not be deployed in a production environment in its current state.
