Agent: Board meeting monitorAbout 10 hours ago
ID: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
Log file: None
Regulation: ISO27001
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition, here is the security and compliance assessment.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, titled **"Board meeting monitor"**, is designed to run on a recurring schedule twice daily (9:00 AM and 6:00 PM). Its workflow is:
1.  **Search:** It accesses a corporate Google Calendar (authenticated as `m@mftestco.com`) to search for events matching the query "Board meetings" scheduled for the following day.
2.  **Logic:** It checks the time of execution.
3.  **Notification:**
    *   **Morning:** It sends an email summary of these meetings to a hardcoded email address (`m@testco.com`) using Gmail.
    *   **Afternoon:** It sends an SMS notification to a hardcoded phone number (`+14155312776`) via Twilio.

### 2. ISO 27001 Applicability
**Yes, ISO 27001 is applicable.**

*   **Asset Management (A.8):** The agent utilizes corporate information assets (Google Workspace credentials, Twilio API keys).
*   **Information Classification (A.8.2):** The agent explicitly targets "Board meetings." In an enterprise context, board meeting schedules, attendees, and agendas are classified as **Confidential** or **Restricted** information (often constituting Material Non-Public Information - MNPI).
*   **Access Control (A.9):** The agent performs automated access to corporate data stores.

### 3. Specific Violations of ISO 27001
The following are definitive, significant violations found in the configuration JSON:

**A. Violation of Principle of Least Privilege (Control A.9.1.2 / 8.2)**
*   **Evidence:** The Google Auth configuration (`id: 693b2e84...`) grants the agent the following scopes:
    *   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` (Full access to all files)
    *   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` (Full access to all sheets)
    *   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify` (Read/Write/Delete access to email)
*   **Risk:** The agent *only* requires `calendar.readonly` and `gmail.send`. Granting full Drive and Spreadsheet access creates a critical vulnerability. If this agent is compromised, the attacker has full access to the user's entire corporate file repository, not just the calendar data.

**B. Insecure Transfer of Sensitive Information (Control A.13.2.3 / 5.14)**
*   **Evidence:** The agent transmits Board Meeting data via SMS (`Twilio.sendSMS`) to an external mobile number (`+14155312776`).
*   **Risk:** SMS is not an encrypted channel (neither in transit over the carrier network nor at rest on the device). Transmitting Board-level data (Confidential) via SMS violates standard encryption requirements for sensitive data transfer.

**C. Hardcoded Personal Data & Routing (Control A.14.2.5 / 8.33)**
*   **Evidence:** The recipient email (`m@testco.com`) and phone number (`+14155312776`) are hardcoded directly into the agent's logic configuration ("manualResult").
*   **Risk:** This violates Information Lifecycle Management. If the owner of that phone number leaves the organization, the agent will continue sending confidential Board data to a personal device. There is no central directory lookup to validate the recipient's current employment status.

### 4. Remediation Recommendations
1.  **Scope Reduction (Critical):** Revoke the current Google OAuth token. Re-authenticate the agent requesting *only* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly` and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send`. Remove all Drive, Spreadsheet, and Gmail Modify scopes.
2.  **Disable SMS for Confidential Data:** Remove the Twilio/SMS workflow entirely. Board meeting data should only be transmitted via secure, logged corporate channels (e.g., internal email with TLS, or a secure collaboration tool like Slack/Teams).
3.  **Variable-Based Routing:** Replace hardcoded email addresses and phone numbers with variables that pull from a managed directory or a distribution list (e.g., `board-admins@testco.com`). This ensures that if an employee leaves, they automatically stop receiving alerts.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**NON-COMPLIANT**

The combination of **excessive privileges** (Full Drive access) and the **transmission of Board-level data over unencrypted SMS** presents an unacceptable risk profile for an enterprise environment. Immediate remediation is required before deployment.
