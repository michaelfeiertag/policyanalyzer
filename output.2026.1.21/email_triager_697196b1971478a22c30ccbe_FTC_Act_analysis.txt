Agent: Email Triager
ID: email-triager-697196b1971478a22c30ccbe
Log file: None
Regulation: FTC-Act
============================================================

Based on the review of the [AGENT_DEFINITION] provided, here is the assessment regarding the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act).

### 1. Summary of the Agent's Function
The **Email Triager** agent monitors an incoming Gmail inbox. It evaluates incoming emails and categorizes them using specific labels (Important, Question, Newsletter, Spam, Customer FAQ). 

If an email is identified as a "Customer FAQ," the agent executes a secondary workflow: it searches a connected Knowledge Base for an answer and automatically sends a reply email to the sender with the retrieved information. All other categories result only in internal labeling without external interaction.

### 2. Whether FTC-Act is Applicable and Why
**Yes, the FTC Act is applicable.**

**Reasoning:**
*   **Section 5 (Unfair or Deceptive Acts):** The FTC Act applies to "acts or practices in or affecting commerce." This agent automates customer service interactions ("Customer FAQ" path) by sending replies to external parties (consumers/customers).
*   **Deceptive Practices:** The FTC enforces against AI tools that impersonate humans to deceive consumers. If an automated agent mimics a human without disclosure, it constitutes a deceptive practice under Section 5.
*   **Commercial Interaction:** The agent is engaging in active correspondence with customers regarding inquiries, which falls squarely under commercial conduct regulated by the FTC.

### 3. Whether Specific Violations of FTC-Act are Found
**No definitive violations of the FTC Act were found.**

**Analysis:**
*   **Disclosure of Identity (Deception):** The primary risk for customer-facing agents under the FTC Act is "bot impersonation" (pretending to be a human).
    *   The agent's configuration for the `SendToGmail` node explicitly includes a signature field: `"sig": "Sent via [Lindy](https://lindy.ai)"`.
    *   By explicitly signing the email as being sent via an AI tool/platform, the agent discloses its non-human nature. It is not attempting to deceive the recipient into believing they are conversing with a human employee.
*   **Unfairness:** The agent replies to incoming inquiries based on a Knowledge Base. Unless the Knowledge Base contains fraudulently incorrect information (e.g., false pricing or warranty promises), the mechanism of the agent itself does not constitute an "unfair practice" that causes unavoidable injury to the consumer.
*   **Internal Labeling:** The logic used to label emails internally (Spam, Newsletter, etc.) allows for internal organization and does not impact the consumer directly, therefore presenting no FTC Act risk.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
While the agent is currently compliant, the following recommendations will ensure continued adherence to FTC guidance regarding AI transparency:

*   **Maintain Signature Configuration:** Ensure the `"sig"` field in the `SendToGmail` action is locked or monitored. If a user were to remove "Sent via Lindy" and replace it with "Best, Michael," the agent would immediately become non-compliant (Deceptive Practice/Impersonation).
*   **Knowledge Base Accuracy:** Ensure the "Customer FAQ Knowledge Base" source data is accurate. If the AI consistently provides false information about product efficacy or billing based on the Knowledge Base, this could be construed as a deceptive practice via automation.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

The agent includes clear disclosure of its automated nature in its outgoing communications and performs standard triage tasks that do not violate Section 5 of the FTC Act.
