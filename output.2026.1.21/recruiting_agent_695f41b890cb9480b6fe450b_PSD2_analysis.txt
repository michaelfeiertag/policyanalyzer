Log file: None
Regulation: PSD2
============================================================

Based on the review of the [AGENT_DEFINITION] provided, here is the assessment regarding PSD2 (Revised Payment Services Directive) compliance.

### 1. Summary of the Agent's Function
The "Recruiting Agent" is an automation tool designed to assist with talent acquisition and sales prospecting. Its primary workflows include:
*   **Lead Sourcing:** Searching for candidates (people) and companies using the *People Data Labs* integration based on criteria like job title, location, and industry.
*   **Data Organization:** creating and populating Google Sheets with the gathered lead data.
*   **Outreach:** Sending emails to identified leads via a *Gmail* integration and sending summaries to the user via chat.

### 2. Is PSD2 Applicable?
**No, PSD2 is not applicable to this agent.**

**Reasoning:**
PSD2 (Directive (EU) 2015/2366) specifically regulates **Payment Service Providers (PSPs)** within the European Economic Area. It applies to services that:
1.  Access payment accounts (Account Information Services - AISP).
2.  Initiate payment transactions (Payment Initiation Services - PISP).
3.  Issue card-based payment instruments.

This agent performs **none** of these functions.
*   It does not connect to banking APIs.
*   It does not aggregate financial transaction history.
*   It does not initiate money transfers or process payments.
*   The data handled (names, emails, job titles, public company funding data) is professional/contact data, not sensitive payment data or authentication credentials for financial institutions.

### 3. Specific Violations of PSD2
**None.**

As the agent operates entirely outside the regulatory scope of payment services, it cannot violate PSD2 requirements. It functions purely as a CRM and Communication tool.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
**No remediation is required regarding PSD2.**

*Note: While outside the scope of your specific question regarding PSD2, this agent processes high volumes of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) via People Data Labs. You should review this agent separately against **GDPR** or **CCPA** standards, as regulatory risk lies in data privacy, not payment services.*

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
*(The agent is compliant because the regulation is Not Applicable).*
