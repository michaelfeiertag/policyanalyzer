ID: lead-outreacher-6971943a0197c79d295d27cb
Log file: None
Regulation: PSD2
============================================================

Based on the provided `[AGENT_DEFINITION]`, here is the compliance assessment regarding **PSD2 (Payment Services Directive 2)**.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, titled "Lead Outreacher," functions as an autonomous Sales Development Representative (SDR). Its primary workflow is:
1.  **Ingestion:** It monitors a specific Google Sheet for new rows (leads).
2.  **Execution:** It sends a sequence of three personalized cold outreach emails via Gmail to the lead.
3.  **Logic:** It utilizes timers to space emails by three days and includes logic to cancel the sequence if a reply is detected.
4.  **Scope:** It operates strictly within the Google Workspace ecosystem (Sheets, Gmail, Drive).

### 2. PSD2 Applicability
**PSD2 is NOT applicable to this agent.**

**Reasoning:**
*   **Scope of Regulation:** PSD2 regulates Payment Service Providers (PSPs), Third-Party Providers (TPPs), and the access to payment accounts (Account Information Services) or the initiation of transactions (Payment Initiation Services).
*   **Agent Capabilities:** This agent's permissions (scopes) are strictly limited to communication and document management (`gmail.send`, `spreadsheets`, `calendar`, `drive`).
*   **No Financial Interaction:** The agent does not access bank account interfaces (APIs), does not initiate fund transfers, does not aggregate financial transaction data, and does not process payments. It is a marketing and communication tool, not a financial instrument.

### 3. Specific Violations of PSD2
**No violations found.**

As the agent does not perform any activities regulated under PSD2 (such as accessing payment account data or initiating payments), it cannot violate the directive. There are no "Significant Violations" to report.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
*   **No remediation required regarding PSD2.**
*   *Note:* While outside the specific scope of your PSD2 query, you should review this agent against **GDPR** and **CAN-SPAM** regulations, as it automates cold emailing using personal data (names, emails) derived from a spreadsheet.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
*(The agent is Compliant because the regulation is outside the scope of the agent's defined functions and permissions.)*
