ID: lindy-agent-lister-693c78bb39099082df392692
Log file: None
Regulation: PCI-DSS
============================================================

Based on the provided `[AGENT_DEFINITION]` and the instructions to assume no violations in the absence of evidence to the contrary (given the absence of the `[SAMPLE_LOG]` content in your prompt), here is the assessment.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Lindy Agent Lister" is an administrative utility agent. It triggers on a recurring hourly schedule (`0 * * * *`). Upon triggering, it performs the following workflow:
1.  Retrieves a list of all agents within the Lindy workspace.
2.  Iterates through this list (up to 500 items).
3.  Updates or upserts rows in a specific Google Sheet (`1auUbfTVe3XnLfvMoFdLsC8nqO5QW0srkyIvyBGyZu2Q`).
4.  The specific data points recorded are **AgentID**, **Agent Name**, and **Last Task Date**.

### 2. PCI-DSS Applicability
**Applicability:** **No.**

**Reasoning:** PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) applies solely to system components that store, process, or transmit Cardholder Data (CHD) (e.g., Primary Account Numbers) or Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD).

This agent is configured strictly to handle internal system metadata:
*   Unique Identifiers (AgentID)
*   Configuration Labels (Agent Name)
*   Timestamps (Last Task Date)

There is no evidence in the definition that this agent interacts with payment gateways, processes transactions, or has access to customer financial data.

### 3. Specific PCI-DSS Violations
**None.**

*   **Data Scope:** The input and output schema defined in the `GoogleSheets` node (`columnsToUpdate`) are restricted to administrative metadata.
*   **Storage/Transmission:** As the data being transmitted to Google Sheets is not Cardholder Data, the transmission and storage mechanisms do not fall under PCI-DSS scoping requirements.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
*   **None required.** The agent operates outside the scope of the PCI Data Security Standard.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant** (Not Applicable)
