ID: ai-cmo-research-agent-697194e773107647553ffb5a
Log file: None
Regulation: PCI-DSS
============================================================

Based on the review of the provided agent definition (`AI CMO | Research Agent`), here is the assessment regarding PCI-DSS compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent functions as an automated Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) researcher. Its workflow involves:
1.  Accepting a company URL from the user.
2.  Using search tools (Perplexity, Google, Browser scraping) to gather public information about the company, its industry, competitors, and keywords.
3.  Using an LLM (Lindy) to generate marketing assets, including customer personas, value propositions, and brand guidelines.
4.  Creating and populating Google Docs with this research.
5.  Looping through identified competitors to perform deep research.

### 2. PCI-DSS Applicability
**PCI-DSS is NOT Applicable.**

PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) applies solely to entities and systems that store, process, or transmit Cardholder Data (CHD) or Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD).

*   **Input Analysis:** The only user input requested is a "company website URL."
*   **Data Processing:** The agent scrapes **publicly available** website text and uses LLMs to generate marketing strategies. While the agent requests "pricing" information (Node `697194e773107647553ffb65`), this refers to public pricing models (marketing data), not payment transaction processing.
*   **Output Analysis:** The outputs are marketing research documents and competitor analysis.

There is no evidence in the agent definition that it interacts with payment gateways, requests credit card numbers (PAN), or handles CVV codes.

### 3. Specific Violations
**No PCI-DSS violations found.**

*   **Data Scope:** The agent does not touch the Common Data Element (CDE) scope.
*   **Storage:** No credit card data is being written to the generated Google Docs.
*   **Transmission:** No payment data is being transmitted to third-party models (Perplexity/Lindy).

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
No remediation is required for PCI-DSS compliance, as the standard does not apply to this workload.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**

*(Note: While the agent is PCI-DSS compliant because it does not handle payment data, the agent creates Google Docs with the permission "Anyone with the link can edit." This is not a PCI violation regarding this specific data set, but it is a general data governance observation.)*
