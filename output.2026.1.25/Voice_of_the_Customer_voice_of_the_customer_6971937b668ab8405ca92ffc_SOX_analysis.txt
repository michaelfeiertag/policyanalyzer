ID: voice-of-the-customer-6971937b668ab8405ca92ffc
Log file: None
Regulation: SOX
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition and the parameters of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), here is the compliance assessment.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Voice of the Customer" agent monitors a specific calendar (`m@mftestco.com`) for events. When an event starts, the agent joins the meeting via "LindyMeeting" to record and transcribe the audio. It utilizes a logic node to determine if the meeting was a "Customer call." If affirmative, it uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract and edit noteworthy quotes regarding product feedback (sentiment, competitor comparison, pros/cons). Finally, it sends these summarized quotes to a distribution list via **Gmail**.

*Note: The agent description text mentions sending data to "Slack," but the actual executable code (Node `...008`) is configured to use the **Gmail** tool. The assessment is based on the actual code execution (Gmail).*

### 2. SOX Applicability
**Not Applicable.**

**Reasoning:**
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) governs the accuracy of corporate financial disclosures, Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR), and the retention of records relevant to financial audits. This agent operates exclusively on **qualitative product feedback and marketing sentiment data**.

*   **No Financial Data Impact:** The agent does not read from or write to financial systems of record (e.g., ERP, General Ledger, Payroll, Invoicing).
*   **No Revenue Recognition Impact:** While the agent records customer interactions, it extracts subjective sentiment ("what they like or don't like"), not contractual terms or purchase orders required for revenue verification.
*   **No Materiality:** The output (edited quotes in an email) is not material to financial statements.

### 3. Specific Violations
**None.**

*   **Data Integrity (Section 302/404):** The prompt explicitly instructs the AI to *"slightly change it from what the person exactly said... removing repeated words."* While this manipulation of data would be a critical violation if applied to financial figures or audit trails, it is permissible for informal product feedback summaries.
*   **Data Retention (Section 802):** The configuration notes that "Video recording URLs are valid for 24 hours." Since the content is non-financial product feedback, the rapid destruction of the source raw data does not violate SOX document retention policies.

### 4. Remediation Recommendations
No remediation is required for SOX compliance.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
