Regulation: PCI-DSS
============================================================

Here is the assessment for the agent "RudeResponder" based on the provided definition.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent is a Microsoft Power Automate (Logic App) flow designed to act as an automated email responder. It triggers upon the receipt of a new email in a connected Office 365 inbox where the subject line contains the string "marketing". Upon triggering, it automatically sends a reply to the original sender with the subject "Re: [Original Subject]" and the body body text "Your marketing message is not appreciated."

### 2. PCI-DSS Applicability
**Not Applicable.**

PCI-DSS applies to system components that store, process, or transmit cardholder data (CHD) or sensitive authentication data (SAD), or that could impact the security of the cardholder data environment (CDE).

Based on the provided definition:
*   The agent interacts exclusively with an email API (Office 365).
*   The logic filters for "marketing" emails and sends a static text response.
*   There are no connections to payment gateways, financial databases, or file systems containing transaction logs.
*   The agent performs no financial transactions.

### 3. Specific Violations
**None.**

There is no evidence in the agent definition that it interacts with Primary Account Numbers (PAN) or other payment data. The inputs are email metadata (Subject/From address) and the output is a static string. As there is no cardholder data involved, there are no violations of encryption, storage, or transmission requirements under PCI-DSS.

### 4. Recommendations
*   **No remediation required.** The agent does not introduce PCI-DSS risk.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**
