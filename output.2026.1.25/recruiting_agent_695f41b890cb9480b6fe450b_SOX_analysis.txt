Agent: recruiting-agent-695f41b890cb9480b6fe450b
ID: recruiting-agent-695f41b890cb9480b6fe450b
Log file: None
Regulation: SOX
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition, here is the assessment regarding Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) compliance.

**Note on Sample Log:** The prompt referenced a `[SAMPLE_LOG]`, but only the `[AGENT_DEFINITION]` was provided. The assessment is based strictly on the logic and capabilities defined in the agent's code.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Recruiting Agent" functions as an automated Sales Development Representative (SDR). Its primary workflows are:
*   **Lead Identification:** Queries an external database (People Data Labs) to find individuals or companies based on criteria (role, location, industry).
*   **Data Organization:** Creates a new Google Sheet and populates it with lead contact information (Name, Title, Company, Email, LinkedIn).
*   **Outreach:** Optionally iterates through the list of leads to send emails via a connected Gmail account.

### 2. SOX Applicability
**Determination: Not Applicable**

**Reasoning:**
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) specifically governs the accuracy of financial reporting, the integrity of financial records, and the internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR).
*   **Nature of Data:** This agent processes **prospecting and recruiting data** (leads, external contact info). It does not access, generate, or modify financial data (revenue, expenses, payroll, assets, or liabilities).
*   **System Interaction:** The agent interacts with People Data Labs (external data), Google Sheets (unstructured data), and Gmail. It does not interact with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, General Ledgers, or Payroll systems where financial material misstatements could originate.
*   **Outcome:** The output is a list of potential candidates/sales targets. While this may eventually lead to a hire (payroll) or a sale (revenue), the *act* of lead generation is an operational task, not a financial reporting control.

### 3. Specific Violations
**None Found.**

There is no evidence in the agent definition that it interacts with systems or data covered under SOX Sections 302, 404, or 409.
*   **Section 404 (Internal Controls):** The agent does not bypass authentication to financial systems or alter financial workflows.
*   **Section 802 (Data Retention/Destruction):** The agent creates new spreadsheets; it does not delete or alter existing corporate records.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **None required for SOX compliance.**

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
