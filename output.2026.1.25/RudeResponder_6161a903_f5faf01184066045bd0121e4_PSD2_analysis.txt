ID: 6161a903-f5fa-f011-8406-6045bd0121e4
Log file: None
Regulation: PSD2
============================================================

Based on the review of the [AGENT_DEFINITION] provided, here is the assessment regarding PSD2 compliance.

### 1. Summary of the Agent's Function
The agent, titled "RudeResponder," is a simple automated workflow triggered by the arrival of a new email via Office 365. It filters for emails containing the word "marketing" in the subject line. When triggered, it automatically replies to the sender with the text: "Your marketing message is not appreciated."

### 2. PSD2 Applicability
**PSD2 is NOT Applicable.**

The Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) regulates payment services and payment service providers within the European Union. Its scope covers Account Information Service Providers (AISPs), Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs), and the security of payment transactions (Strong Customer Authentication).

This agent utilizes standard Office 365 email connectors (`shared_office365`). It does not:
*   Access payment account information.
*   Initiate payment transactions.
*   Interact with banking APIs.
*   Process or store sensitive authentication data related to financial accounts.

As the agent performs strictly communication-based tasks (email automation) with no financial or payment processing component, it falls outside the regulatory scope of PSD2.

### 3. Specific Violations of PSD2
**No violations found.**

There is no evidence in the agent definition that it interacts with regulated payment data or interfaces. Consequently, there are no violations of PSD2 standards regarding API access, SCA (Strong Customer Authentication), or secure communication standards (RTS).

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **None required.** The agent does not interact with any systems or data governed by PSD2.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**

*(Note: While the agent is compliant with PSD2, the rating reflects only that specific regulation as requested. The agent poses no risk under this specific directive.)*
