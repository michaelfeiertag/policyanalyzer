Regulation: ECPA
============================================================

Here is the assessment of the "AI CMO | Research Agent" regarding the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA).

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent functions as an automated market research analyst. Triggered by a user providing a specific company website URL, the agent:
*   Uses **Perplexity** and **Google Search** to gather public intelligence on the company, its industry, and competitors.
*   Uses a **Browser** tool to visit the provided URL and scrape the text content (`getTextContentFromWebpage`) to analyze brand tone and messaging.
*   Synthesizes this data using **LLMs** to generate customer personas, value propositions, and SWOT analyses.
*   **Creates Google Docs** in the user's connected drive to store these reports (Competitor Analysis, Customer Profiles, Brand Guidelines).

### 2. ECPA Applicability
**Applicability:** **Low / Not Applicable.**

**Reasoning:**
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) consists of the Wiretap Act (intercepting communications in transit) and the Stored Communications Act (SCA) (accessing private communications in storage).
*   **Wiretap Act:** The agent does not intercept private communications between third parties (e.g., sniffing email traffic or chat logs in real-time).
*   **Stored Communications Act:** The agent interacts with **publicly available websites** and the **user's own Google Drive**. The SCA protects private electronic communications (like emails or private messages) held by service providers from unauthorized access. It does not protect public data on public websites.

### 3. Specific Violations
**No ECPA violations found.**

*   **Public Data Access:** The agent utilizes `Browser: search` and `Browser: getTextContentFromWebpage`. Accessing and scraping publicly accessible websites is not a violation of the ECPA, as public website content is not a private electronic communication.
*   **Authorized Storage Access:** The agent utilizes `GoogleDocs: create`. The agent is performing actions within the user's authenticated session/drive. ECPA allows access to stored communications where the user provides consent/authorization. As the user triggers the agent to create these documents, there is no unauthorized access.
*   **No Interception:** There is no logic in the agent definition that attempts to tap into email streams, Slack channels, or private message queues.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
No remediation is required for ECPA compliance based on the provided definition.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
