Agent: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
ID: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
Log file: None
Regulation: COPPA
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition, here is the assessment regarding COPPA compliance.

### 1. Summary of the Agent's Function
The "Board meeting monitor" is an automated internal workflow designed to track corporate schedules. It triggers twice daily (at 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM) to scan a connected calendar for "board meetings" occurring the following day that start before 9:00 AM PT. Based on the time of day the agent runs, it notifies a specific recipient either via email (`m@testco.com`) or SMS (`+14155312776`) regarding these events.

### 2. Applicability of COPPA
**COPPA is NOT applicable to this agent.**

**Reasoning:**
*   **Target Audience:** The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) applies to operators of commercial websites and online services directed to children under 13, or those with actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information from children under 13. This agent is an enterprise productivity tool designed for monitoring corporate board meetings. It is directed at adult employees.
*   **Nature of Interaction:** The agent runs on a recurring timer (backend automation) rather than interacting with users via a frontend interface. It does not solicit input from users, nor does it have an interface where a child could enter personal information.
*   **Data Source:** The agent pulls data from a corporate calendar API and pushes notifications to pre-configured contact details. It does not collect data from the public.

### 3. Specific Violations of COPPA
**No violations found.**

As the regulation is not applicable to an internal enterprise tool designed for adults, and there is no mechanism for the agent to interact with or collect data from children, there are no violations. The sample log was not required to make this determination as the agent definition strictly defines a closed, automated loop involving specific corporate accounts.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **No remediation required** regarding COPPA.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**
