Agent: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
ID: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
Log file: None
Regulation: PSD2
============================================================

Based on the provided [AGENT_DEFINITION] and the absence of a [SAMPLE_LOG] (implying no evidence of violation in execution), here is the assessment regarding PSD2 compliance.

### 1. Summary of the Agent's Function
The agent, titled "Board meeting monitor," is designed to check a user's calendar twice daily (at 09:00 and 18:00) for board meetings scheduled for the following day that start before 9 AM PT. Based on the time of day the agent runs (morning vs. afternoon), it notifies a specific recipient via Gmail or Twilio SMS regarding these calendar events.

### 2. PSD2 Applicability
**PSD2 is NOT applicable to this agent.**

The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) regulates payment services, payment service providers, and the access to payment account information (Open Banking) within the European Economic Area.

*   **Scope of Data:** This agent accesses Calendar data (dates, times, event titles), Email, and SMS capabilities. It does not access, retrieve, or process payment account information (e.g., bank balances, transaction history).
*   **Scope of Action:** The agent performs data retrieval (Calendar) and communication (Email/SMS). It does not initiate payments, transfer funds, or act as a Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP) or Account Information Service Provider (AISP).

### 3. Specific Violations of PSD2
**No violations found.**

As the agent does not interact with financial institutions, handle sensitive payment authentication data, or perform payment transactions, it falls entirely outside the scope of PSD2 regulations. There are no mechanisms in the agent definition that attempt to bypass Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) or access banking APIs without authorization.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **None required.** The agent is functionally unrelated to payment processing or banking data.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**
