ID: email-follow-up-reminder-697193e459a8d688e24a5b67
Log file: None
Regulation: PSD2
============================================================

Based on the provided [AGENT_DEFINITION] and the context of the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2), here is the assessment.

### 1. Summary of the Agent's Function
The agent ("Email Follow-up Reminder") is an email productivity automation tool. Its workflow is as follows:
1.  **Trigger:** It monitors the user's Gmail account for sent messages.
2.  **Logic:** It uses AI to determine if a sent email requires a response.
3.  **Action:** If a response is required, it waits for a configured period (3 days).
4.  **Logic:** It checks if a reply was received.
5.  **Action:** If no reply is detected, it creates a draft follow-up email in Gmail for the user to review and send.

### 2. PSD2 Applicability
**PSD2 is NOT Applicable.**

**Reasoning:**
PSD2 (Payment Services Directive 2) regulates payment services and payment service providers (PSPs) within the European Union. It specifically targets:
*   **Account Information Service Providers (AISPs):** Services that aggregate financial data from bank accounts.
*   **Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs):** Services that initiate payments on behalf of the user directly from their bank account.
*   **Card Based Payment Instrument Issuers (CBPIIs).**

This agent interacts exclusively with **Gmail**. It does not:
*   Access payment accounts (bank accounts, credit card portals).
*   Initiate transactions or transfer funds.
*   Aggregate financial data for the purpose of financial management.
*   Interact with open banking APIs.

While an email system may incidentally contain receipts or invoices, the agent operates as a communication tool, not a financial intermediary or regulated Third Party Provider (TPP). Therefore, it falls outside the regulatory perimeter of PSD2.

### 3. Specific Violations
**None.**

As the agent does not perform any regulated payment activities, it is not subject to Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements, dynamic linking, or open banking API standards associated with PSD2.

### 4. Specific Recommendations
*   **No remediation required regarding PSD2.**

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

*Note: The agent is compliant because the regulation does not apply to its current functional scope.*
