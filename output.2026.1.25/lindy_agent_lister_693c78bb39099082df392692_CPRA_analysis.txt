Agent: lindy-agent-lister-693c78bb39099082df392692
ID: lindy-agent-lister-693c78bb39099082df392692
Log file: None
Regulation: CPRA
============================================================

Here is the assessment of the "Lindy Agent Lister" agent regarding CPRA compliance.

**1. Summary of the Agent's Function**
The agent is designed to run on an hourly recurring schedule. It accesses the internal Lindy API to retrieve a list of all other agents currently existing within the user's workspace. It iterates through this list and upserts (updates or inserts) specific metadata—specifically the `AgentID`, `Agent Name`, and `Last Task Date`—into a specific external Google Sheet (`1auUbfTVe3XnLfvMoFdLsC8nqO5QW0srkyIvyBGyZu2Q`).

**2. CPRA Applicability**
**Not Applicable / Low Relevance.**
CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act) regulates the collection, processing, sharing, and retention of "Personal Information" (PI) belonging to California residents (consumers, employees, and B2B contacts).

Based on the [AGENT_DEFINITION], this agent processes the following data points:
*   `AgentID` (System-generated unique identifier for software)
*   `Agent Name` (Label for the software configuration)
*   `Last Task Date` (System timestamp)

These data points constitute system configuration metadata and operational logs regarding software entities. They do not meet the definition of Personal Information under Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.140(v)(1), as they do not identify, relate to, describe, or link to a natural person or household. Consequently, the specific obligations of CPRA (Right to Know, Right to Delete, Opt-out of Sale/Sharing) are not triggered by the operation of this agent.

**3. Specific Violations of CPRA**
**None Found.**
As the agent does not process, store, or transmit Personal Information (PI) or Sensitive Personal Information (SPI), it does not violate CPRA data minimization, retention, or security requirements regarding consumer data.

*   **Note on Sample Log:** As no sample log was provided (`[SAMPLE_LOG]` was referenced but not attached), and the definition strictly limits data collection to system metadata (`AgentID`, `Agent Name`, `Last Task Date`), there is no evidence to suggest the agent is scraping or processing user inputs or PII. Per instructions, we assume no violation exists absent evidence.

**4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation**
*   **None required for CPRA.**
*   *Operational Note:* Ensure the target Google Sheet does not inadvertently become a repository for user-entered agent names that might contain PII (e.g., "Agent for John Doe - 555-0199"), though this is a low-risk edge case and not a direct violation by the agent itself.

**5. Overall Compliance Rating**
**Compliant**
