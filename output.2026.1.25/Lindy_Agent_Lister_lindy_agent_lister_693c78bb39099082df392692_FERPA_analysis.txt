ID: lindy-agent-lister-693c78bb39099082df392692
Log file: None
Regulation: FERPA
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition and the instructions to avoid speculation and ignore missing evidence, here is the FERPA compliance assessment. Note that while a `[SAMPLE_LOG]` was referenced in your prompt, it was not included in the text provided; this assessment is based strictly on the `[AGENT_DEFINITION]` and the logic that absence of evidence equals no violation.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Lindy Agent Lister" is an administrative utility agent. It triggers on a recurring hourly schedule to retrieve a list of all other agents existing within the Lindy workspace. It iterates through this list and updates a specific Google Sheet ("Lindy Agents") with the following metadata for each agent: `AgentID`, `Agent Name`, and `Last Task Date`.

### 2. FERPA Applicability
**Not Applicable.**

FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) applies to "education records" that contain personally identifiable information (PII) directly related to a student.

The data processed by this agent is strictly **IT infrastructure metadata** (Agent IDs, Agent Names, and timestamps of system tasks). Unless the organization has a non-standard naming convention where agents are named using full student legal names (which would be speculative to assume without logs), this data does not constitute an education record. The management of software inventory is an operational function, not an educational one involving student academic, disciplinary, or health records.

### 3. Specific Violations of FERPA
**None.**

*   **Data Nature:** The agent does not ingest, process, or output student grades, transcripts, schedules, or student PII.
*   **Data Destination:** While the agent writes to an external Google Sheet, the data being written (System IDs and generic names) falls outside the scope of FERPA protection.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **No FERPA remediation required.**
*   *Operational Note:* Ensure the Google Sheet ID `1auUbfTVe3XnLfvMoFdLsC8nqO5QW0srkyIvyBGyZu2Q` has appropriate access controls (ACLs) to prevent unauthorized viewing of enterprise infrastructure data, though this is a general security best practice and not a specific FERPA requirement in this context.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**
