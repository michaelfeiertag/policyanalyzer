Agent: voice-of-the-customer-6971937b668ab8405ca92ffc
ID: voice-of-the-customer-6971937b668ab8405ca92ffc
Log file: None
Regulation: ISO27001
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition (JSON) and the absence of the referenced Sample Log (assuming none was provided in the text block, I must rely strictly on the static configuration), here is the assessment.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Voice of the Customer" agent is designed to trigger when a calendar event starts. It joins the meeting using the "LindyMeeting" tool to record and transcribe audio. If the AI determines the meeting was a "customer call," it extracts noteworthy quotes, creates a summary, and sends this information via **Gmail**.

*Note: The agent's description and greeting claim it sends messages to **Slack**, but the actual logic executes a **Gmail** action. There is no Slack integration in the active node list.*

### 2. ISO27001 Applicability
**Applicable: Yes**

ISO27001 is applicable to this agent for the following reasons:
*   **Asset Management (A.8):** The agent processes proprietary business information and customer data (audio recordings and transcripts).
*   **Information Transfer (A.13):** The agent automates the transmission of sensitive data (internal analysis of customer sentiment) via email.
*   **Privacy and PII:** The agent records voices and names, which constitutes PII handling requiring protection under ISMS controls.

### 3. Specific ISO27001 Violations

**Violation 1: Failure of Documented Operating Procedures (Control A.12.1.1)**
*   **Evidence:** The agent's `description` and `greetingMessage` explicitly state: "sends the noteworthy quotes to your team on Slack." However, the active node configuration (`id: 6971937b668ab8405ca93008`) utilizes the `Gmail` tool.
*   **ISO Context:** ISO27001 requires that operating procedures be documented and maintained accurately. A discrepancy where the system performs a different action (Email) than the one documented/promised to the user (Slack) represents a failure in integrity and operational transparency. This creates a risk where data is sent to a channel that may have different retention or security policies than the one the user authorized.

**Violation 2: Undefined Information Transfer Destination (Control A.13.2.1)**
*   **Evidence:** In the `Gmail` node configuration, the `to` (recipient) field is missing entirely. The `body` prompt instructs the AI to "Send a message to the team," but without a hardcoded recipient in the configuration, the agent must infer the recipient or default to the calendar attendees.
*   **ISO Context:** Policies and procedures for the transfer of information must be in place. Leaving the recipient of sensitive data (internal quotes about competitors/products) undefined creates a high probability of **Data Leakage**. If the agent defaults to "Reply All" on the calendar invite, internal business intelligence will be emailed directly to the external customer.

**Violation 3: Lack of Information Availability/Retention (Control A.12.3.1)**
*   **Evidence:** The `LindyMeeting` tool description warns: "Video recording URLs are valid for 24 hours... Upload ... for long-term storage." The agent workflow ends after sending the email summary; it does not include a step to save the recording to persistent storage (e.g., Google Drive).
*   **ISO Context:** This violates controls regarding the backup of information and protection against loss of data. The primary asset (the recording) is destroyed after 24 hours by design, which may violate enterprise data retention policies for customer interactions.

### 4. Remediation Recommendations

1.  **Correct Documentation Mismatch:** Update the Agent Description and Greeting to accurately reflect that notifications are sent via Email, not Slack. Alternatively, replace the Gmail node with a Slack node to match the description.
2.  **Hardcode Recipient Address:** Explicitly configure the `to` field in the Gmail node with a specific internal distribution list (e.g., `product-feedback@mftestco.com`). Do not rely on the AI to infer the recipient or allow it to default to meeting attendees.
3.  **Implement Data Persistence:** Add a node following the recording step to upload the media file to a sanctioned enterprise storage solution (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive) to ensure the data is not lost after the 24-hour expiration window.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Non-Compliant**

The agent contains definitive configuration errors that pose a significant risk of data leakage (sending internal notes to customers) and fails to accurately document its own behavior (claiming Slack usage while using Email). These are substantive violations of ISO27001 controls regarding Information Transfer and Operations Security.
