ID: lindy-agent-lister-693c78bb39099082df392692
Log file: None
Regulation: SOX
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition and the instructions to strictly avoid speculation and focus only on definitive SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley) violations, here is the assessment.

**Note on Sample Log:** The `[SAMPLE_LOG]` was referenced but not provided in the prompt. As per your instructions, I have proceeded based on the agent definition and assumed no violations exist that are not evident in the logic.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **Lindy Agent Lister** is an operational maintenance agent.
*   **Trigger:** It runs on a recurring hourly schedule (`0 * * * *`).
*   **Process:** It retrieves a list of all agents within the Lindy workspace.
*   **Output:** It iterates through this list and updates a specific Google Sheet ("Lindy Agents") with the `AgentID`, `Agent Name`, and `Last Task Date`.

### 2. SOX Applicability
**Verdict: Not Applicable**

**Reasoning:**
SOX (specifically Sections 302 and 404) governs the accuracy of financial reporting and the internal controls surrounding the systems that generate financial data.
*   **Data Classification:** The data handled by this agent (`AgentID`, `Agent Name`, `Last Task Date`) is **operational metadata**. It describes the configuration of the automation platform itself.
*   **Financial Impact:** This data does not constitute financial records, transaction logs, revenue data, payroll, or customer billing information.
*   **IT General Controls (ITGC):** While ITGC covers change management and access to financial systems, a list of agent names in a Google Sheet is unlikely to be a "Key Report" or "Information Produced by Entity" (IPE) relied upon for financial auditing purposes.

### 3. Specific Violations of SOX
**None Found.**

*   There is no interaction with financial databases or ledgers.
*   There is no evidence of improper separation of duties regarding financial transactions.
*   There is no evidence of data tampering regarding financial reporting.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
**None.**

Since the agent falls outside the scope of Financial Reporting and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR), no SOX-specific remediation is required.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
