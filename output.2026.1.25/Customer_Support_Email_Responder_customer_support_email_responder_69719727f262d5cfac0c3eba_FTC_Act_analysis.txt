Regulation: FTC-Act
============================================================

Based on the provided [AGENT_DEFINITION] and the instructions to assume no violation if evidence is absent (noting that [SAMPLE_LOG] was referenced but not provided in the text), here is the assessment regarding the FTC Act.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Customer Support Email Responder" is an automated workflow designed to monitor a specific Gmail inbox. Upon receiving a message, it queries a connected Knowledge Base. If relevant information is found, the agent uses an LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to **draft** a response email. The configuration explicitly sets the action to `saveAsDraft: true`, meaning the agent prepares the response but requires human intervention to send it. It includes a signature indicating the message was generated via Lindy.

### 2. FTC Act Applicability
**Yes, the FTC Act is applicable.**
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act, specifically Section 5, prohibits "unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce." This applies to this agent because:
*   **Commercial Communication:** The agent is drafting responses to customer support inquiries on behalf of a business.
*   **AI Disclosures:** The FTC has issued guidance stating that failing to disclose that a consumer is interacting with an AI (impersonating a human) can be considered a deceptive practice.
*   **Truth in Advertising:** If the agent hallucinates or provides false information regarding products/services based on the Knowledge Base, it could constitute deceptive claims.

### 3. Specific Violations of FTC Act
**No definitive violations found.**

*   **Deception (Impersonation):** The agent configuration includes a mandatory signature: `"Sent via [Lindy](https://lindy.ai)"`. This serves as a clear disclosure to the consumer that an automated tool was involved, satisfying FTC transparency expectations regarding AI interaction.
*   **Deception (Accuracy):** The system prompt explicitly instructs the model: *"Only answer via knowledge that you found in your knowledge base."* While LLMs can hallucinate, the instruction attempts to ground the truth.
*   **Unfairness (Consumer Harm):** Crucially, the configuration `saveAsDraft` is set to `true`. This creates a "Human-in-the-Loop" workflow. Because the AI cannot send the email to the consumer without a human reviewing and clicking send, the risk of the AI autonomously delivering deceptive, harmful, or unfair information is effectively nullified. The human reviewer bears the final responsibility for the content.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
No remediation is required for the current configuration. The agent operates within a safe "draft-only" mode.

*   *Note:* If the `saveAsDraft` setting is ever changed to `false` (enabling auto-sending), a full review of the `[SAMPLE_LOG]` would be required to ensure the AI does not hallucinate false claims, as the "Human-in-the-Loop" safety layer would be removed.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**
