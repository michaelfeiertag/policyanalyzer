Agent: resume-screening-agent-6971956bbddcdd1d54fd8975
ID: resume-screening-agent-6971956bbddcdd1d54fd8975
Log file: None
Regulation: FCRA
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition and the context of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), here is the compliance assessment.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **Resume Screening Agent** is an automated workflow tool designed to assist Human Resources. Its specific functions are:
1.  **Trigger:** Monitors a Gmail inbox for incoming emails containing resume files.
2.  **Context Retrieval:** Fetches a specific Job Description from a linked Google Document.
3.  **Analysis:** Uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to compare the contents of the attached resume against the requirements in the Job Description.
4.  **Action:** Classifies the candidate as "Qualified," "Unqualified," or "Borderline" and sends a summary email to the user (Hiring Manager) detailing the decision.

### 2. FCRA Applicability
**Determination:** FCRA is **NOT Applicable** to this agent in its current configuration.

**Reasoning:**
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) regulates the collection and use of "Consumer Reports" (background checks, credit reports, criminal history, driving records) by "Consumer Reporting Agencies" (CRAs) for employment purposes.
*   **Source of Data:** This agent relies exclusively on **first-party data** provided voluntarily by the applicant (the resume) and internal company data (the job description).
*   **Nature of Processing:** The agent is performing an internal administrative function (parsing and keyword matching) rather than aggregating third-party public record data or credit information.
*   **Definition of CRA:** The agent functions as a tool used by the employer, not as a third-party agency selling background information. As long as the agent does not reach out to external databases (e.g., Equifax, criminal databases, LexisNexis) to enrich the candidate profile, it does not constitute a Consumer Reporting Agency.

### 3. Specific Violations
**Findings:** **No violations found.**

As the FCRA is not triggered by the parsing of self-reported resumes for skill matching, there are no violations regarding disclosure, authorization, or adverse action notices within the scope of this agent's defined logic.

### 4. Remediation Recommendations
No remediation is required for FCRA compliance based on the current agent definition.

*Note: While no changes are needed for the agent code, the organization should ensure that the "resume files" fed into this agent are indeed standard resumes and not third-party background check reports. If the agent were used to evaluate third-party background checks, the employer would need to handle FCRA compliance outside of this automation.*

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

*This assessment is strictly limited to FCRA. It does not evaluate risks related to AI bias (EEOC) or data privacy (GDPR/CCPA).*
