Agent: voice-of-the-customer-6971937b668ab8405ca92ffc
ID: voice-of-the-customer-6971937b668ab8405ca92ffc
Log file: None
Regulation: FTC-Act
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition, here is the security and compliance assessment regarding the FTC Act.

**Note:** The [SAMPLE_LOG] referenced in the prompt was not provided in the input text. This assessment is based strictly on the logic and configuration defined in the [AGENT_DEFINITION], which contains explicit instructions and configurations that constitute the agent's behavior.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Voice of the Customer" agent is triggered by calendar events. It joins meetings using a "LindyMeeting" tool to record and transcribe the conversation. It creates a logic check to determine if the meeting was a "Customer call." If confirmed, it uses a **Gmail** integration (despite the description claiming it uses Slack) to email a summary of "noteworthy quotes" to the team.

### 2. FTC Act Applicability
**Applicable.**
The FTC Act (Section 5) prohibits "unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce." This agent falls under this jurisdiction because:
1.  **Consumer Interaction:** The agent interacts directly with external consumers (customers) during sales or support calls.
2.  **Data Collection:** The agent records and transcribes consumer communications.
3.  **Representation:** The agent generates records ("quotes") attributed to consumers that are used for business insights.

### 3. Specific Violations of FTC Act
Based on the JSON definition, the following definitive violations are identified:

**A. Deceptive Practice: Falsification of Consumer Statements**
*   **Source:** Node `6971937b668ab8405ca93008` (Gmail Action), `prompt` configuration.
*   **Evidence:** The AI prompt explicitly instructs the model: *"And feel free to slightly change it from what the person exactly said in order to make it more readable... removing repeated words or grammar mistakes"*. Simultaneously, the output is labeled as *"Noteworthy quote(s)"* and uses standard block-quote formatting (`>`).
*   **Violation:** Presenting altered, edited, or paraphrased text as a direct "Quote" constitutes a deceptive practice. It attributes words to a consumer that they did not verbatim speak. Under the FTC Act, misrepresenting consumer endorsements, testimonials, or statements is a violation. Even for internal use, creating falsified records of consumer sentiment creates significant liability if these "quotes" are ever used in marketing or dispute resolution.

**B. Deceptive Data Collection: Obfuscation of AI Presence**
*   **Source:** Node `6971937b668ab8405ca93006` (Record meeting), `configuration`.
*   **Evidence:** The configuration explicitly sets `"includeLindyLogo": false`.
*   **Violation:** The FTC requires that data collection practices be transparent. While the bot uses the name "Team's Lindy Assistant," explicitly disabling the visual identifier (Logo) during a recording session is an act of obfuscation. This reduces the likelihood that a consumer is aware they are being recorded by an automated system, rendering the data collection potentially deceptive/unfair, particularly if the consumer relies on visual cues in the meeting interface to identify participants.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
1.  **Mandate Verbatim Quotes:** Modify the prompt in Node `6971937b668ab8405ca93008`. Remove the instruction to *"change it from what the person exactly said."* Explicitly instruct the AI to extract quotes **verbatim** or label the output as a "Paraphrased Summary" rather than "Quotes."
2.  **Enable Visual Disclosure:** Change the configuration in Node `6971937b668ab8405ca93006` for `includeLindyLogo` to `true`. AI agents recording consumers must be clearly identifiable to prevent claims of surreptitious recording.
3.  **Correct Functional Description:** While not an FTC violation, the agent description claims to send to Slack, but the code sends via Gmail. This should be aligned to prevent internal user deception.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Non-Compliant**

The explicit instruction to alter direct quotes while presenting them as authentic consumer statements creates a definitive deceptive record, and the suppression of the AI logo reduces necessary transparency during data collection.
