ID: 6161a903-f5fa-f011-8406-6045bd0121e4
Log file: None
Regulation: EU-AI-Act
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition (`RudeResponder`) and the parameters of the EU AI Act, here is the compliance assessment.

### 1. Summary of the Agent's Function
The agent is a deterministic automation workflow (Microsoft Power Automate Cloud Flow) named "RudeResponder." Its function is strictly rule-based:
*   **Trigger:** It monitors a specific Office 365 email inbox for incoming messages where the subject line contains the string "marketing."
*   **Action:** When the trigger condition is met, it automatically sends a reply to the sender with the static body text: "Your marketing message is not appreciated."

### 2. EU AI Act Applicability
**Not Applicable.**

**Reasoning:**
Under **Article 3(1)** of the EU AI Act, an "AI system" is defined as a machine-based system that exhibits adaptiveness and infers, from inputs, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions.

This agent does not meet the definition of an AI system for the following reasons:
*   **No Inference:** The system does not use machine learning, logic-based approaches, or knowledge-based approaches to infer information. It utilizes a simple conditional logic (If Subject contains "X", Then send "Y").
*   **No Adaptiveness:** The system logic is static and hardcoded. It does not evolve or learn from data.
*   **Recital 6 Exemption:** The EU AI Act explicitly clarifies that simple rule-based systems defined solely by natural persons to automatically execute operations are not considered AI systems.

### 3. Specific Violations of EU AI Act
**None.**

As the software does not meet the legal definition of an AI System, it falls outside the scope of the regulation. Consequently, it cannot violate the provisions of the Act.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **Classification Documentation:** Record this agent in your internal inventory as "Rule-Based Automation" or "Legacy Scripting" rather than "AI" to ensure it is excluded from future AI governance audits.
*   **No further action required** regarding the EU AI Act.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**

(The agent is compliant by virtue of non-applicability; it presents no regulatory risk under this specific legislation.)
