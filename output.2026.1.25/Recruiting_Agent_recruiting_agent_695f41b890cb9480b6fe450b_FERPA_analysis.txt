Agent: recruiting-agent-695f41b890cb9480b6fe450b
ID: recruiting-agent-695f41b890cb9480b6fe450b
Log file: None
Regulation: FERPA
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition and the instructions to assume no violation in the absence of evidence (as the [SAMPLE_LOG] was referenced but not provided in the prompt), here is the assessment regarding FERPA compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Recruiting Agent" is designed to act as a Sales Development Representative (SDR). Its primary functions are:
*   **Lead Generation:** It queries a third-party data aggregator ("People Data Labs") to find individuals based on criteria such as job title, location, industry, skills, and **education (schools, degrees)**.
*   **Data Organization:** It compiles this data (Name, Job Title, Email, LinkedIn URL, etc.) into a Google Sheet.
*   **Outreach:** It has the capability to draft and send emails to these leads via Gmail integration.

### 2. FERPA Applicability
**FERPA is likely NOT applicable to this agent's operation.**

*   **Reasoning:** FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) governs the privacy of student education records maintained by **educational agencies and institutions** (e.g., universities, public schools).
*   **Data Source:** This agent retrieves data exclusively from **People Data Labs (PDL)**. PDL is a commercial data aggregator that scrapes information from public sources (like LinkedIn, social media, and public resumes).
*   **Distinction:** Information regarding a person's education (e.g., "Attended Harvard") found in a public commercial database or on a social networking site is **not** considered an "education record" under FERPA. FERPA protects records held by the school itself (e.g., transcripts, disciplinary records). Since this agent does not connect to a Student Information System (SIS) or internal university registrar database, it is not accessing protected records.

### 3. Specific Violations of FERPA
**No FERPA violations found.**

*   **Analysis of "School" Filter:** The agent logic (Edge `695f41b990cb9480b6fe4514`) allows users to filter leads by "Education (schools, degrees, etc)." Using a third-party tool to search for "Graduates of [University]" creates a list based on public self-reported data, not institutional records. This does not constitute an unauthorized disclosure of education records.
*   **Data Storage:** The agent stores the retrieved data in Google Sheets. As the data source is non-proprietary public data, storing it does not violate FERPA storage requirements for student records.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
*   **No remediation is required regarding FERPA.**
*   *Note:* While no action is needed for FERPA, ensure the organization has the right to use People Data Labs data for commercial solicitation under other privacy frameworks (which are outside the scope of this specific assessment).

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

The agent operates entirely outside the scope of FERPA jurisdiction as it relies on third-party commercial data rather than protected institutional education records.
