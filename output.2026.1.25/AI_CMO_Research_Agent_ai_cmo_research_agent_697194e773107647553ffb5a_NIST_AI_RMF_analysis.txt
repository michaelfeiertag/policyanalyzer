ID: ai-cmo-research-agent-697194e773107647553ffb5a
Log file: None
Regulation: NIST-AI-RMF
============================================================

Here is the assessment of the agent "AI CMO | Research Agent" based on the provided definition and NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0) standards.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "AI CMO | Research Agent" is a generative AI workflow designed to automate market research and strategic planning. It takes a company URL as input, scrapes the website, and uses Perplexity AI models to identify competitors, analyze brand tone, and estimate financial metrics. It then uses internal LLMs to generate buyer personas, customer journey maps, and value propositions. Finally, it generates multiple Google Documents containing this sensitive business intelligence and outputs the links to the user.

### 2. NIST AI RMF Applicability
**Applicable.**
The NIST AI RMF applies to this agent because:
1.  **Generative Capability:** The agent utilizes Large Language Models (Perplexity Sonar, Lindy LLM) to synthesize new content, infer psychological profiles, and estimate market data, which introduces risks regarding validity and reliability (hallucinations).
2.  **Decision Support:** The agent produces strategic business artifacts (Competitor Analysis, Market Size Analysis) intended to inform high-level organizational decisions.
3.  **Third-Party Integration:** The system integrates multiple external AI services and file storage systems, requiring governance over data flow and security.

### 3. Specific Violations of NIST AI RMF
The agent contains **definitive, significant violations** of the **Secure & Resilient** and **Privacy-Enhanced** characteristics of the NIST AI RMF.

**Violation 1: Insecure Default Output Permissions (Critical)**
*   **NIST RMF Reference:** **Secure & Resilient (1.2)** and **Privacy-Enhanced (1.6)**. AI systems must ensure data confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access or modification of outputs.
*   **Evidence:** In the agent definition, multiple Google Drive `create` actions are hardcoded to create documents with public write access.
    *   **Node `...ffb78` (Create Competitor Document):** `sharingPreference` is set to `"Anyone with the link can edit"`.
    *   **Node `...ffb7c` (Company | Customer Profile):** `sharingPreference` is set to `"Anyone with the link can edit"`.
    *   **Node `...ffb85` (Competitor Analysis):** `sharingPreference` is set to `"Anyone with the link can edit"`.
    *   **Node `...ffb86` (Company | Customer Psychology):** `sharingPreference` is set to `"Anyone with the link can edit"`.
    *   **Node `...ffb88` (Company | Offering Context):** `sharingPreference` is set to `"Anyone with the link can edit"`.
    *   **Node `...ffb8a` (Company | Brand Guidelines):** `sharingPreference` is set to `"Anyone with the link can edit"`.
    *   **Node `...ffb8c` (Company | Marketing Offers):** `sharingPreference` is set to `"Anyone with the link can edit"`.
*   **Risk:** This configuration publishes sensitive corporate strategy, competitive intelligence, and internal research to the public web. Anyone who guesses or intercepts the link can not only view the data (Privacy violation) but also modify or delete the content (Integrity/Security violation).

**Violation 2: Hardcoded Data Storage Targets (System Reliability)**
*   **NIST RMF Reference:** **Reliable (1.2)**. AI systems should function consistently and properly across their lifecycle.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Nodes `...ffb7c`, `...ffb86`, `...ffb87`, `...ffb88`, `...ffb8a`, `...ffb8c`:** The `googledocs-folder` input is hardcoded to a specific ID: `1g8A373DKGNTI2ofPgy0S_btYkUmfrfSB`.
*   **Risk:** This presents a significant reliability and data governance risk.
    1.  **Availability:** If the user running the agent does not have write access to this specific hardcoded folder (which likely belongs to the original developer), the agent will fail.
    2.  **Data Commingling:** If multiple users within the enterprise run this agent, all their distinct research reports are forced into the same folder, potentially exposing one department's research to another unauthorized department.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
1.  **Restrict Document Permissions:** Immediately update all Google Docs `create` nodes (specifically nodes ending in `b78`, `b7c`, `b85`, `b86`, `b88`, `b8a`, `b8c`) to change `sharingPreference` from `"Anyone with the link can edit"` to `"Private (only me)"` or `"Domain Restricted"`.
2.  **Remove Hardcoded Folder IDs:** Replace the hardcoded value `1g8A373DKGNTI2ofPgy0S_btYkUmfrfSB` in the `googledocs-folder` field with a dynamic variable (e.g., asking the user to select a folder) or default to the user's root drive (`*`).
3.  **Implement Confidence Disclaimers:** Ensure the final output to the user includes a disclaimer regarding the "Revenue" and "Market Share" estimates generated by Perplexity (Node `...ffb73`), as these are high-risk hallucination vectors.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Non-Compliant**

The agent introduces immediate data leakage risks by generating sensitive strategic documents with public-write permissions by default. It cannot be safely deployed in an enterprise environment in its current state.
