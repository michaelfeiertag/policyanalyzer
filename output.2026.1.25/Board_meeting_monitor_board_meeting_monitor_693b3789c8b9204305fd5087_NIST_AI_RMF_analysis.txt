### Assessment: NIST AI RMF Compliance
**Agent Name:** Board meeting monitor
**ID:** `693b3789c8b9204305fd5087`

#### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent triggers twice daily (9:00 AM and 6:00 PM). Upon triggering, it utilizes an AI model to search a connected Calendar for "board meetings" occurring the following day before 9:00 AM PT.
- If the agent determines it is the "morning" (via a Logic node), it sends an email to `m@testco.com` via Gmail.
- If the agent determines it is the "afternoon" (via a Logic node), it sends an SMS to `+14155312776` via Twilio.

#### 2. NIST AI RMF Applicability
**Applicable: Yes**
The NIST AI Risk Management Framework applies to this agent for the following reasons:
1.  **AI System Use:** The agent employs an LLM (`model: "md"`) to interpret natural language queries regarding dates and times ("next day", "before 9am PT") and to perform logic routing.
2.  **High-Impact Data Context:** The agent processes "Board meeting" data. Information regarding board schedules, attendees, and existence is often classified as Material Non-Public Information (MNPI) or highly sensitive internal governance data.
3.  **Generative Output:** The agent generates external communications (SMS/Email) based on AI interpretation of this sensitive data.

#### 3. Specific Violations of NIST AI RMF
*Note: The [SAMPLE_LOG] referenced in the prompt was not provided in the input. This assessment is based strictly on the risk introduced by the [AGENT_DEFINITION].*

**A. Violation of "Privacy-Enhanced" and "Secure" Characteristics (NIST AI RMF: MAP 3.1, MANAGE 4.1)**
*   **Issue:** The agent is configured to transmit Board-level data via SMS (Twilio) to a hardcoded mobile number.
*   **Risk:** SMS is widely considered an insecure channel (vulnerable to interception, spoofing, and SIM swapping). Transmitting the existence or details of Board meetings via unencrypted SMS violates the principle of keeping data secure and privacy-enhanced.
*   **Evidence:** Node `693b38d0...` (Twilio) is hardcoded to send data to `+14155312776` when triggered by the calendar search for board meetings.

**B. Violation of "Reliability" and "Validity" (NIST AI RMF: MAP 1.5)**
*   **Issue:** The "Logic" node (`693b38af...`) is responsible for routing traffic based on the conditions "it's the morning" or "it's the afternoon." However, the input to this node is the output of the Calendar search (a list of events), not the system time.
*   **Risk:** The AI is being asked to determine the time of day based on inputs that do not contain the time of day. This creates a high probability of **hallucination** or **validity failure**, where the agent may fail to send alerts or send them to the wrong channel because the AI lacks the context to evaluate the condition reliably.
*   **Evidence:** The Edge connections flow from `Calendar` -> `Logic`. There is no "Current Time" tool input into the Logic node.

**C. Violation of "Transparency" and "Safety" (NIST AI RMF: GOVERN 5.2)**
*   **Issue:** The Action nodes for Gmail (`693b3810...`) and Twilio (`693b38d0...`) lack a defined `body` or `content` configuration.
*   **Risk:** In the absence of a defined message body, AI agents often default to summarizing the input context (the Calendar search results) or passing the raw data. This creates a significant **Data Leakage** risk. The agent may inadvertently send meeting agendas, Zoom links, or sensitive descriptions found in the calendar invite via SMS/Email, rather than a generic "Meeting Alert."
*   **Evidence:** The `configuration` arrays for both Action nodes define recipients (`to`, `phoneNumberTo`) but do not define the message content.

#### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
1.  **Restrict Output Channels (Privacy/Security):** Remove the Twilio/SMS integration for Board-level data. Restrict notifications to secure, authenticated enterprise channels (e.g., Corporate Email, Slack, MS Teams) where access logs and encryption are enforced.
2.  **Define Deterministic Logic (Reliability):** Do not use an AI Logic node to determine the time of day. Use a deterministic "Time Check" tool or pass the trigger timestamp explicitly to the Logic node to ensure the "Morning" vs. "Afternoon" routing is valid.
3.  **Template Output Content (Safety/Transparency):** Explicitly configure the `body` of the Email and SMS actions with a hardcoded template (e.g., *"Automated Alert: Please check your secure calendar for upcoming board meetings."*). Ensure the AI is not permitted to generate the message body or summarize the calendar event details into the message.

#### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Non-Compliant**

The agent introduces significant risk by routing sensitive governance data (Board meetings) through insecure channels (SMS) and relying on undefined AI behavior for message content generation (potential data leak) and flow logic (reliability failure).
