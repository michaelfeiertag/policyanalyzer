Log file: None
Regulation: ePrivacy-Directive
============================================================

Based on the provided [AGENT_DEFINITION] and the instructions to assume no violation in the absence of evidence, here is the assessment regarding the **ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC)**.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Personal Computer Assistant" is a desktop automation agent designed to control the user's terminal equipment ("LindyComputer"). Its defined workflow initiates a computer control session (`startComputer`) and transitions to a state labeled "Send Instagram DM." The agent is designed to execute user-directed commands on the local machine.

### 2. Applicability of ePrivacy Directive
**Applicable.**
The ePrivacy Directive is applicable to this agent for two specific reasons:
*   **Article 5(3) (Terminal Equipment):** The agent functions by accessing and storing information on the user's terminal equipment (the computer) via the `LindyComputer` tool.
*   **Article 13 (Unsolicited Communications):** The agent includes a specific capability to send electronic communications ("Send Instagram DM"). The Directive regulates the sending of unsolicited communications for direct marketing purposes.

### 3. Specific Violations of ePrivacy Directive
**None Found.**
Based on the strict constraint to identify only definitive, significant violations and to avoid speculation:

*   **Regarding Article 5(3) (Cookies/Storage):** While the agent accesses the user's computer, this access appears strictly necessary to provide the "information society service" explicitly requested by the user (i.e., the user installs a computer assistant to assist with computer tasks). This falls under the exemption for strictly necessary storage/access. There is no evidence in the definition that the agent installs third-party advertising trackers or accesses data unrelated to the requested task.
*   **Regarding Article 13 (Spam):** The agent has a state to "Send Instagram DM." However, the agent's greeting ("What do you want me to do?") implies the actions are user-initiated. There is no hardcoded logic in the JSON definition indicating the agent performs automated, unsolicited bulk messaging or direct marketing. Without a log file showing the agent autonomously spamming users without consent, the capability to send a DM is not a violation in itself.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **N/A:** No remediation is required based on the provided definition.
*   *Operational Note:* Ensure that the "Send Instagram DM" action remains strictly responsive to user prompts (solicited) and is not used for automated outbound marketing campaigns, which would change the compliance status.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**
