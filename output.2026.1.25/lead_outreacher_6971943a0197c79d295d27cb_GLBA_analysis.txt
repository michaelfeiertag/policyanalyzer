Agent: lead-outreacher-6971943a0197c79d295d27cb
ID: lead-outreacher-6971943a0197c79d295d27cb
Log file: None
Regulation: GLBA
============================================================

Here is the assessment of the "Lead Outreacher" agent regarding GLBA compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Lead Outreacher" is an automated Sales Development Representative (SDR) agent. Its primary function is to monitor a specific Google Sheet for new rows of contact data. Upon detecting a new lead, it utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate and send a sequence of three personalized sales emails via a linked Gmail account. The agent includes logic to personalize content based on the recipient's role and company, and includes wait timers between follow-up emails.

### 2. GLBA Applicability
**Determination:** **Not Applicable**

**Reasoning:**
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) applies to "financial institutions" and regulates the privacy and security of **consumer** Non-Public Personal Information (NPI). GLBA explicitly defines a consumer as "an individual who obtains or has obtained a financial product or service... that is to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes."

This agent is explicitly designed for **Business-to-Business (B2B)** commercial outreach, as evidenced by:
*   **Instructions:** The system prompt directs the AI to "consider the recipient’s role, position within the company, company size, and potential pain points."
*   **Templates:** The email templates reference "[Lead's Company]" and "[specific company goal/initiative]."
*   **Data Nature:** The data processed (Business Email, Role, Company Name) constitutes Business Contact Information (BCI), which falls outside the scope of GLBA protection.

Even if the enterprise deploying this agent is a financial institution, soliciting other businesses for commercial purposes does not trigger GLBA consumer privacy requirements.

### 3. Specific Violations
**None identified.**

Since the data processed by this agent is commercial in nature and intended for B2B solicitation, it does not constitute "consumer NPI" under the regulation. Therefore, no specific violations of the GLBA Privacy Rule or Safeguards Rule exist within the agent's logic or definition.

*Note on Dead/No-Op Code:* The agent definition contains disjointed logic regarding timer cancellation (Nodes `6971943a0197c79d295d27dc` and `6971943a0197c79d295d27dd`). For example, the "First outreach email" connects to both a "Wait" timer and a "Cancel first timer" action simultaneously. While this results in functional errors (broken automation flows), it does not create a data leak or compliance violation relevant to GLBA.

### 4. Remediation Recommendations
No remediation is required for GLBA compliance.

*Operational Note:* While not a GLBA violation, ensure the Google Sheet (`spreadsheetId` ending in `...IvyBGyZu2Q`) is access-controlled to prevent unauthorized insertion of actual consumer NPI, which would be a misuse of the agent's intended design.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
