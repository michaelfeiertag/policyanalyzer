Log file: None
Regulation: PCI-DSS
============================================================

Here is the assessment regarding PCI-DSS compliance for the "Lead Outreacher" agent.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Lead Outreacher" is an automated Sales Development Representative (SDR) agent. Its primary function is to execute outbound cold email campaigns.
*   **Input:** It monitors a specific Google Sheet for new rows containing lead information (names, emails, company details).
*   **Processing:** It utilizes AI to generate personalized subject lines and body text for an initial outreach email and two subsequent follow-up emails.
*   **Output:** It sends emails via a connected Gmail account.
*   **Logic:** It employs timers to stagger the follow-up emails over several days.

**Note on Dead Code:** The agent instructions mention: *"Upon receiving a response... promptly relay it to the user via Slack."* However, there is no Slack tool configured in the `triggers` or `nodes` section of the JSON definition. This instruction is non-functional (dead code) and was ignored for this assessment.

### 2. PCI-DSS Applicability
**Verdict: Not Applicable**

PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) applies to entities that store, process, or transmit cardholder data (CHD) or sensitive authentication data (SAD).

*   **Data Source:** The agent ingests data from a Google Sheet intended for sales leads. Standard sales lead data consists of PII (Personally Identifiable Information) such as names and business emails, not financial payment data.
*   **Agent Operations:** The agent performs outbound communication (sending emails). It does not perform transaction processing, accept payments, or query financial databases.
*   **No Evidence of CHD:** There is no evidence in the prompt, node configuration, or AI instructions that the agent requests, parses, or stores Primary Account Numbers (PAN), CVV codes, or expiration dates.

As the agent does not touch the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE), PCI-DSS controls are not applicable to this specific workload.

### 3. Specific Violations of PCI-DSS
**None Found.**

Based on the provided definition and the constraint to avoid speculation:
*   The agent does not interact with payment gateways.
*   The agent does not log keystrokes or sensitive authentication data.
*   The agent does not transmit data to unverified third parties outside of the defined Google/Gmail ecosystem (which are standard enterprise tools, though not used here for payments).

### 4. Remediation Recommendations
While the agent is currently compliant due to non-applicability, the following recommendations ensure it remains out of scope for PCI-DSS:

1.  **Scope Restriction:** Ensure the connected Google Sheet is strictly controlled and that no upstream process populates it with credit card information (e.g., do not use this agent to process "failed payment" lists that might inadvertently contain raw card data).
2.  **Instruction Guardrails:** Although not currently a violation, it is best practice to update the System Instructions to explicitly state: "Do not request or process payment information or credit card details via email."

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

The agent is compliant because it operates entirely outside the scope of PCI-DSS. It does not handle payment card data.
