Agent: personal-computer-assistant-697194cf64cff41a8f386a07
ID: personal-computer-assistant-697194cf64cff41a8f386a07
Log file: None
Regulation: FERPA
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition and the instructions to ignore speculative risks and missing log data, here is the assessment regarding FERPA compliance.

**Note on Inputs:** The prompt referenced a `[SAMPLE_LOG]`, but only the `[AGENT_DEFINITION]` was provided. As per your instructions ("If there is no evidence of a violation assume there is none"), this assessment assumes the missing log contains no evidence of data exfiltration involving student records.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Personal Computer Assistant" is a general-purpose automation agent designed to control a computer session (`LindyComputer`). The definition indicates a specific flow or capability to "Send Instagram DM" immediately following the start of a computer session. It appears to be a productivity tool intended to perform actions on a user's device.

### 2. FERPA Applicability
**Applicability:** **Not Applicable**

**Reasoning:**
FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) applies specifically to the protection of "Education Records" (records directly related to a student and maintained by an educational agency or institution).
*   **No Educational Context:** The agent definition contains no references to students, grades, transcripts, educational institutions, or academic data schemas.
*   **General Purpose Nature:** The agent is defined as a "Personal Computer Assistant" for "seamless device management." It is a generic tool, not an EdTech integration.
*   **Data Handling:** There is no evidence in the definition that this agent ingests or processes Personally Identifiable Information (PII) derived from student records.

### 3. Specific FERPA Violations
**Violations Found:** **None**

**Reasoning:**
*   **No Definition of Protected Data:** The agent does not inherently target or process FERPA-protected Education Records.
*   **No Unauthorized Disclosure Evidence:** While the agent has a capability to "Send Instagram DM," which could theoretically be used to leak data, there is no evidence in the definition (or the absent log) that it is programmed to transmit student data. A tool having the *capability* to send a message is not a FERPA violation; the *actual transmission* of protected student data to an unauthorized third party would be required for a violation.
*   **Dead/Placeholder Code:** The trigger mechanism is listed as "Unknown/Unknown," suggesting the agent may not even be active or fully configured. This further reduces any immediate risk.

### 4. Recommendations
No remediation is required for FERPA compliance based on the provided configuration.

*   **Contextual Note:** If this agent is deployed specifically on computers used by school officials (e.g., teachers, registrars) who have active Education Records on their screens, the "Send Instagram DM" capability should be disabled or strictly monitored to prevent accidental manual exfiltration of student data. However, based strictly on the agent's code definition, no action is required.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Rating:** **Compliant**
