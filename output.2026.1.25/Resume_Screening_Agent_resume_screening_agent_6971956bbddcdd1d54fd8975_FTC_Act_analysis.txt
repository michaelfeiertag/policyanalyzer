Agent: resume-screening-agent-6971956bbddcdd1d54fd8975
ID: resume-screening-agent-6971956bbddcdd1d54fd8975
Log file: None
Regulation: FTC-Act
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition (and noting the absence of the specific text content for [SAMPLE_LOG], relying on the logic and design provided), here is the compliance assessment regarding the **FTC Act**.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **Resume Screening Agent** is an automated workflow designed to assist in the hiring process. It triggers upon receiving an email containing a resume. It retrieves a specific job description from a Google Doc, analyzes the resume against that description using a Large Language Model (LLM), and categorizes the applicant as "Qualified," "Unqualified," or "Borderline." Finally, it drafts and sends an email to the HR/Hiring Manager with a summary of the decision and specific reasons for the classification.

### 2. FTC Act Applicability
**Yes, the FTC Act is applicable.**

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforces **Section 5 of the FTC Act**, which prohibits "unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce." The FTC has explicitly stated that this applies to the use of Artificial Intelligence and Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDT).
*   **Commercial Activity:** Hiring is a commercial activity.
*   **Consumer Impact:** The agent affects consumers (job applicants) by influencing or determining their eligibility for employment.
*   **FTC Guidance:** The FTC has issued specific warnings regarding AI claims (Deception) and AI bias/errors (Unfairness) in hiring and tenant screening.

### 3. Specific Violations of FTC Act
Based on the design and logic provided, the agent introduces **Non-Compliant** risks under Section 5 of the FTC Act.

**A. Unfair Practices (Lack of Substantiation & Testing)**
*   **Violation:** The agent delegates the decision-making logic entirely to a generic LLM (`model: "md"`) without evidence of validity testing. The FTC requires that if a company uses AI to make substantive decisions about consumers (like hiring), the company must substantiate that the tool works as claimed and does not produce biased or arbitrary results.
*   **Evidence:** The agent takes a raw resume and job description and asks the AI to "assign a matching score." There is no intermediate validation layer, no standardized scoring rubric hardcoded into the logic, and no evidence that the model has been tested for disparate impact (bias) against protected classes. Using an unverified "black box" to reject candidates is considered an "unfair practice" because it causes substantial injury (loss of employment opportunity) that the consumer cannot reasonably avoid.

**B. Deceptive Practices (Automated Reasoning)**
*   **Violation:** The agent generates specific reasons for rejection (e.g., "Missing Qualifications," "Skill Gap") in the email body (Node `6971956bbddcdd1d54fd8984`).
*   **Evidence:** LLMs are prone to hallucinations. If the agent invents a missing qualification (e.g., stating a candidate lacks a degree when they have one) and presents this to the Hiring Manager as a fact, the system is engaging in a deceptive practice. The agent presents these AI-generated inferences as definitive assessments without a disclaimer regarding potential error rates.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
To mitigate FTC Act risks, the following changes are required:

1.  **Implement "Human-in-the-Loop" (HITL):** Change the final action from `Gmail: send` to `Gmail: create draft` or use an internal approval tool. A human must review the AI's assessment *before* a decision is finalized or communicated.
2.  **Standardize Evaluation Criteria:** Do not rely on the LLM's "vibe" or internal logic. Modify the prompt to extract specific data points (e.g., "Does the resume contain the string 'Python'? Y/N") rather than asking for a subjective "matching score."
3.  **Validation Testing:** Before deployment, you must run this agent against a dataset of past resumes (both successful and unsuccessful) to verify the model's decisions match historical human decisions and do not statistically discriminate against protected groups.
4.  **Disclaimers:** The email body sent to the Hiring Manager must clearly state that the assessment was generated by AI and may contain errors, requiring verification against the source document.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Non-Compliant**

**Reasoning:** The agent automates a high-stakes employment decision using an unvalidated generic model with no enforced human oversight. This aligns with the FTC's definition of "unfair practices" regarding AI usage in employment. The risk of the agent rejecting qualified candidates based on hallucinations or bias—without human intervention—is a definitive regulatory risk.
