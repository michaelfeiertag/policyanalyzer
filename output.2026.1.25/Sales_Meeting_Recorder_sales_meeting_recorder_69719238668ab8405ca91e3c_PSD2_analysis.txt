Agent: sales-meeting-recorder-69719238668ab8405ca91e3c
ID: sales-meeting-recorder-69719238668ab8405ca91e3c
Log file: None
Regulation: PSD2
============================================================

Here is the assessment regarding PSD2 compliance for the "Sales Meeting Recorder" agent.

### 1. Summary of the Agent's Function
The agent is designed to automate administrative tasks associated with sales calls. Its specific workflow is:
*   **Trigger:** Monitors a specific user calendar (`m@mftestco.com`) for the start of events.
*   **Logic:** Differentiates between internal and external meetings.
*   **Action (Recording):** Joins external video meetings (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet) to record and transcribe audio/video.
*   **Action (Documentation):** Exports meeting notes to a private Google Doc.
*   **Action (Communication):** Drafts and sends a follow-up email to the external attendee via Gmail (requires confirmation).
*   **Cleanup:** Deletes the task if the meeting is internal.

*Note: The node triggering from "Unknown/Unknown" (ID: 69719238668ab8405ca91e59) appears to be dead/no-oped code and was excluded from the functional analysis.*

### 2. Whether PSD2 is Applicable and Why
**PSD2 is NOT applicable to this agent.**

**Reasoning:**
The Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) regulates Payment Service Providers (PSPs), specifically focusing on Payment Initiation Services (PIS) and Account Information Services (AIS). To fall under the scope of PSD2, an application must:
1.  Access payment accounts (bank accounts).
2.  Initiate payment transactions.
3.  Aggregate financial data from banking institutions.

This agent interacts exclusively with **Calendar**, **Video Conferencing**, **Google Docs**, and **Gmail** APIs. It does not interface with banking APIs, process financial transactions, access account balances, or handle sensitive payment authentication data (SCA). It is a productivity tool, not a financial technology tool.

### 3. Whether Specific Violations of PSD2 are Found
**No violations found.**

As the agent does not process payments or interact with regulated financial data, it cannot violate the provisions of PSD2 regarding Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), secure communication standards (RTS), or unauthorized access to payment account information.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **None required.** No remediation is necessary regarding PSD2 as the regulation does not apply to the agent's current functionality.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**
