Regulation: SOX
============================================================

Here is the assessment regarding Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) compliance for the "Lead Outreacher" agent.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Lead Outreacher" is an automated Sales Development Representative (SDR) agent. Its primary function is to ingest contact information (Leads) from a Google Sheet and execute a three-stage cold email marketing campaign via Gmail. It utilizes AI to generate subject lines and body copy for initial outreach and follow-ups based on the lead's data.

### 2. SOX Applicability
**Not Applicable.**

**Reasoning:**
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) is specifically designed to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures made pursuant to the securities laws. It focuses on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR).

*   **Data Scope:** This agent processes "Sales Leads" (marketing prospects). This is pre-revenue, non-financial data. It does not interface with the General Ledger, ERP systems, Payroll, Invoicing, or Revenue Recognition modules.
*   **Financial Impact:** The actions taken by this agent (sending marketing emails) do not directly alter the company's financial statements or balance sheet.
*   **IT General Controls (ITGC):** While the agent uses IT resources (Gmail, Google Sheets), these specific instances are used for marketing automation, not for the generation, storage, or processing of financial data regulated under SOX Section 404.

### 3. Specific Violations
**None.**

As the agent operates entirely outside the scope of financial reporting and data processing relevant to SOX, there are no violations of Section 302 (Corporate Responsibility for Financial Reports), Section 404 (Management Assessment of Internal Controls), or Section 802 (Criminal Penalties for Altering Documents).

### 4. Remediation Recommendations
No remediation is required for SOX compliance.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant** (Out of Scope)
