ID: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
Log file: None
Regulation: FTC-Act
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition and the instruction to assume no violations where evidence is absent (due to the missing log file content), here is the assessment regarding the FTC Act.

### 1. Summary of the Agent's Function
The "Board meeting monitor" is an internal administrative automation tool. It runs on a recurring schedule (twice daily: 9 AM and 6 PM). Its primary function is to scan a connected calendar for board meetings scheduled for the following day that begin before 9 AM PT.
*   **If triggered in the morning:** It sends an email notification to `m@testco.com`.
*   **If triggered in the afternoon:** It sends an SMS notification to a specific phone number (`+1415...`) via Twilio.

### 2. FTC Act Applicability
**Applicability: Low / Not Applicable to Consumer Protection Context**

The FTC Act (Section 5) prohibits "unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce." Its primary application regarding software agents involves:
1.  **Deception:** Misleading consumers about what the AI does, impersonating humans to consumers without disclosure, or failing to protect consumer data contrary to privacy promises.
2.  **Unfairness:** Causing substantial injury to consumers that is not reasonably avoidable (e.g., unauthorized charges, massive data leaks).

This specific agent is strictly an **internal productivity tool** designed to notify an employee/stakeholder about calendar events. It does not interact with external consumers, it does not market products, and it does not make public-facing claims. Therefore, the specific provisions of the FTC Act regarding consumer protection and commercial deception are not triggered by this agent's logic.

### 3. Specific Violations of FTC Act
**Violations Found: None**

*   **No Deceptive Practices:** The agent identifies itself in the email signature ("Sent via Lindy") and performs exactly the task described in its configuration (checking a calendar and sending a notification). There is no attempt to defraud or mislead the recipient.
*   **No Unfair Practices:** The agent operates on fixed, hardcoded endpoints (specific email and phone number) and uses standard APIs (Calendar, Gmail, Twilio). It does not exhibit behavior that causes injury to consumers or the enterprise.
*   **Data Security/Privacy (FTC Context):** While the agent handles internal data (calendar details), it does so within the scope of authorized use. There is no evidence in the definition that it broadcasts this data publicly or mishandles it in a way that would constitute an "unfair" data practice under FTC enforcement standards.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **None Required:** The agent is compliant with the FTC Act as defined.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
