Agent: resume-screening-agent-6971956bbddcdd1d54fd8975
ID: resume-screening-agent-6971956bbddcdd1d54fd8975
Log file: None
Regulation: PCI-DSS
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition and the instructions to assume no violations if the sample log shows no evidence (or in this case, where the log is absent and the definition is benign), here is the assessment.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **Resume Screening Agent** is an automated HR tool designed to streamline the hiring process. Its workflow is as follows:
1.  **Trigger:** It listens for incoming emails via Gmail.
2.  **Input Processing:** It detects if an email contains a resume file.
3.  **Context Retrieval:** It fetches a specific Job Description from a hardcoded Google Docs URL.
4.  **Analysis:** It compares the resume content against the job description criteria.
5.  **Output:** It sends a structured email back to the user (Hiring Manager) classifying the candidate as "Qualified," "Unqualified," or "Borderline," including a summary of pros and cons.

### 2. PCI-DSS Applicability
**Verdict: Not Applicable**

**Reasoning:**
PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) applies specifically to entities that store, process, or transmit **Cardholder Data (CHD)** (e.g., Primary Account Numbers) or **Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD)**.

*   **Data Domain:** This agent is designed to process **employment data** (Resumes, Job Descriptions, Candidate Evaluations).
*   **No Financial Transactions:** There is no logic, tool usage, or intent within the agent's definition to handle payments, credit card numbers, or financial transactions.
*   **Scope:** As the agent does not interact with the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE), it falls outside the scope of PCI-DSS regulatory requirements.

### 3. Specific Violations of PCI-DSS
**None Found.**

*   **Analysis:** The agent utilizes Gmail and Google Docs to handle text and document files. There is no code or logic path that requests, validates, stores, or transmits credit card information.
*   **Dead Code:** The trigger with ID `6971956bbddcdd1d54fd897b` (Tool: Unknown) is identified as dead/no-op code. It does not perform any action and poses no PCI-DSS risk.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
Since the agent is currently outside the scope of PCI-DSS, no remediation is required to achieve compliance. However, to maintain this status:

*   **Maintain Scope Isolation:** Ensure this agent is never connected to systems that store customer payment profiles.
*   **Input Sanitization (Best Practice):** While not a current violation, ensure that if a candidate accidentally emails a credit card number on a resume (unlikely but possible), the agent does not persist that data into long-term storage logs.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

*Note: This rating indicates the agent does not violate PCI-DSS because it does not process the data types governed by that standard.*
