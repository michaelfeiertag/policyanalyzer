Agent: meeting-scheduler-697192e92908dc843c114766
ID: meeting-scheduler-697192e92908dc843c114766
Log file: None
Regulation: FERPA
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition and the instructions to assume no violation if no evidence exists (particularly given the absence of the referenced log file), here is the assessment regarding FERPA compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Meeting Scheduler" agent functions as an automated executive assistant. It monitors email threads where it is CC'd, parses natural language to identify scheduling requests, checks the user's associated calendar for availability, negotiates times via email replies (using `LindyMail`), and creates or deletes calendar events. It utilizes an AI model to generate context-aware email responses and event titles.

### 2. FERPA Applicability
**Applicability:** **Conditional / Context-Dependent**

FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) applies only if the "large enterprise" is an educational agency or institution (or a vendor acting as a "School Official" for one) receiving federal funds.

*   **If the Enterprise is a standard corporation:** FERPA is **Not Applicable**.
*   **If the Enterprise is an Educational Institution:** FERPA is **Applicable**. The agent processes Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names and email addresses. Furthermore, the agent generates calendar event titles (e.g., "Student Name : Professor Name [Context]"). If the "Context" involves academic performance, disciplinary actions, or health data, the calendar entry constitutes an "Education Record" protected by FERPA.

### 3. Specific Violations of FERPA
**Assessment:** **No Definitive Violations Found**

Based strictly on the provided JSON definition, there are no definitive, significant violations of FERPA logic.

*   **Data Transmission:** The agent replies to "all" (`"replyTo": "all"` in node `697192e92908dc843c11476e`). In a FERPA context, replying to all recipients on a thread initiated by a student or faculty member is generally considered acceptable behavior for a communication tool, as the participants are already established on the thread.
*   **Data Storage/Generation:** The agent creates events on the user's primary calendar. While this stores data, it is done under the user's credentials. Unless the user has publicly shared their calendar with unauthorized parties, this does not constitute an unauthorized disclosure.
*   **Logic Flow:** The logic restricts actions to scheduling and rescheduling based on explicit user triggers. It does not autonomously query or broadcast student records.

*Note: While the use of a third-party AI processor (Lindy) implies data transfer to a vendor, this is a vendor management issue (requiring a "School Official" designation/contract), not a code-level violation within the agent's definition.*

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
Although no violations were found in the code definition, the following best practices ensure continued compliance if deployed in an educational setting:

1.  **Vendor Agreement Verification:** Ensure the enterprise has a Data Processing Addendum (DPA) with the AI provider (Lindy) designating them as a "School Official" with a legitimate educational interest, as the agent processes student names and meeting contexts.
2.  **Calendar Privacy Settings:** Ensure that the Google Calendars (or other calendar systems) connected to this agent are not set to "Public" visibility, preventing the AI-generated event titles (which may contain sensitive context) from being exposed.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

*The agent definition contains no logic that inherently violates FERPA regulations.*
