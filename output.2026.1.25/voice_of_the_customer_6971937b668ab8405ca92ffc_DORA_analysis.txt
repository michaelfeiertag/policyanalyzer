Agent: voice-of-the-customer-6971937b668ab8405ca92ffc
ID: voice-of-the-customer-6971937b668ab8405ca92ffc
Log file: None
Regulation: DORA
============================================================

Based on the provided `[AGENT_DEFINITION]` and the context of DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act), here is the assessment.

**Note:** As the `[SAMPLE_LOG]` was not provided, this assessment is based strictly on the logic and configuration parameters defined in the agent structure.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, named "Voice of the Customer," is designed to automate the capture of customer interactions. Its workflow is as follows:
1.  **Trigger:** Detects the start of a calendar event.
2.  **Action:** Joins the meeting via the `LindyMeeting` tool to record and transcribe audio/video.
3.  **Logic:** Determines if the meeting was a "Customer call."
4.  **Action:** If confirmed as a customer call, it uses `Gmail` to send an email to a team address containing AI-generated "noteworthy quotes" from the transcript.

### 2. DORA Applicability
**Applicable: Yes.**

DORA (Regulation (EU) 2022/2554) applies to financial entities and emphasizes the resilience of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems. This agent falls under DORA's scope for the following reasons:
*   **Critical Data Processing:** The agent captures and processes raw customer interaction data (voice/video). In a financial context, client communications are critical for audit trails, dispute resolution, and transaction verification.
*   **ICT Third-Party Risk:** The agent utilizes external tools (`LindyMeeting`) to capture this data, introducing third-party dependency.
*   **Operational Risk:** The agent automates a business process. Failure of this agent (e.g., loss of recording) impacts the operational integrity of the organization's record-keeping.

### 3. Specific Violations of DORA
Based on the agent definition, there are **Definitive, Significant Violations**.

**Violation 1: Failure to Ensure Data Availability and Retention (Article 12 - Backup policies and procedures and restoration methods)**
*   **Evidence:** The `LindyMeeting` node configuration explicitly states in its `actionDescription`: *"Note: Video recording URLs are valid for 24 hours after a meeting completes. Upload the video to Google Drive or another storage provider for long-term storage."*
*   **The Violation:** The agent workflow **fails to implement the required upload step**. The logic flow moves directly from `Record meeting` to `Gmail`. There is no node (e.g., Google Drive, SharePoint, OneDrive) configured to ingest and persist the recording file.
*   **DORA Impact:** DORA requires financial entities to ensure the availability of data. By relying on a temporary link that self-destructs in 24 hours without an automated backup, the agent guarantees the permanent loss of the source of truth (the raw recording) once that window expires. If the email is lost, filtered to spam, or the link is not manually clicked and downloaded by a human within one day, the record is irretrievable.

**Violation 2: Compromised Data Integrity (Article 8 - Protection and Prevention)**
*   **Evidence:** The `Gmail` node's prompt configuration instructs the AI: *"And feel free to slightly change it from what the person exactly said in order to make it more readable... removing repeated words or grammar mistakes".*
*   **The Violation:** The agent is explicitly programmed to alter the record of a customer conversation.
*   **DORA Impact:** Article 8 mandates that ICT systems ensure the "authenticity, integrity and confidentiality" of data. In a financial context, altering a customer's quote (even for readability) destroys the integrity of the record. Combined with Violation #1 (where the source recording is deleted after 24 hours), the organization is left with *only* an altered, non-verifiable version of the customer interaction.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
To bring this agent into compliance, the following changes are mandatory:

1.  **Implement Long-Term Storage (Critical):**
    *   Insert a new Action node immediately after the `Record meeting` node.
    *   This node must utilize a compliant storage tool (e.g., "Upload to Google Drive" or "Upload to OneDrive").
    *   Map the video URL output from the recording node to the input of the storage node to ensure the file is persisted before the 24-hour window expires.

2.  **Correct Prompt Engineering (Integrity):**
    *   Modify the `Gmail` node prompt. Remove instructions to "change it from what the person exactly said."
    *   Explicitly instruct the model to provide *verbatim* transcripts for any quotes used.

3.  **Update Description (Governance):**
    *   Update the agent description to reflect that it sends emails via Gmail, not messages via Slack, to ensure the documentation matches the technical reality (DORA requires accurate identification of ICT assets).

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Non-Compliant**

The agent introduces a guaranteed data loss scenario (via the 24-hour expiration) regarding customer interactions. This represents an unacceptable operational resilience risk.
