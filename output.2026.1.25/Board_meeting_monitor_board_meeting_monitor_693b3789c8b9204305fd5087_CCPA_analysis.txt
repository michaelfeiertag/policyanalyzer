ID: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
Log file: None
Regulation: CCPA
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition (and the absence of the referenced log file content, leading to the assumption of standard execution), here is the assessment regarding CCPA compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Board meeting monitor" agent runs on a recurring schedule twice daily (9:00 AM and 6:00 PM). It queries a connected Calendar for "board meetings" occurring the following day that start before 9:00 AM PT.
*   **Morning execution:** Sends the results via Gmail to `m@testco.com`.
*   **Afternoon execution:** Sends the results via Twilio SMS to `+14155312776`.

### 2. CCPA Applicability
**Applicability: Low / Not Applicable to Consumer Data**

CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) regulates the collection, sale, and sharing of "Personal Information" (PI) belonging to California "consumers."
*   **Internal Context:** The agent appears to process internal enterprise data (corporate calendar events regarding "board meetings") and communicates with internal stakeholders (a corporate email address `testco.com` and a specific phone number).
*   **Employee Data:** While CCPA now extends to employee data, the automated processing of calendar availability for business scheduling purposes falls within standard employment context exemptions regarding business purpose execution.
*   **No Consumer Interaction:** There is no evidence in the definition that this agent interacts with external customers or collects PI from the general public.

### 3. Specific Violations
**No definitive violations found.**

*   **No "Sale" or "Sharing" of Data:** The agent transmits data to Gmail and Twilio. In the context of an enterprise, these are Service Providers. Transferring data to a Service Provider for a "business purpose" (sending a notification) pursuant to a written contract is **not** considered "selling" or "sharing" under CCPA.
*   **Purpose Limitation:** The agent collects specific data (calendar events) to fulfill a specific request (notification of meetings). This aligns with data minimization principles.
*   **No Unauthroized Collection:** The agent utilizes existing authenticated connections (Calendar, Gmail, Twilio) presumably authorized by the user. It does not scrape public data or aggregate consumer profiles.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
*   **None required.** The agent operates within the scope of internal business administration and does not present a risk of CCPA non-compliance based on the provided definition.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
