Agent: email-triager-697196b1971478a22c30ccbe
ID: email-triager-697196b1971478a22c30ccbe
Log file: None
Regulation: SOX
============================================================

Here is the assessment regarding Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) compliance for the "Email Triager" agent.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Email Triager" is an automation agent designed to monitor a Gmail inbox. It utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to categorize incoming emails based on intent (Newsletters, Spam, Customer FAQs, High Priority, etc.). Its primary actions are:
*   **Labeling:** Applying specific metadata labels to emails within Gmail.
*   **Information Retrieval:** Searching a "Customer FAQ Knowledge Base" when a customer question is detected.
*   **Automated Response:** Drafting and immediately sending replies (not drafts) to customers based on Knowledge Base retrieval results.

### 2. SOX Applicability
**Determination: Not Applicable / Low Relevance**

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) focuses on the accuracy of financial reporting, the integrity of corporate financial records, and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR).

SOX is generally **not applicable** to this agent for the following reasons:
*   **Nature of Data:** The agent processes unstructured communication (email) regarding general customer inquiries, newsletters, and spam. There is no evidence in the definition that the agent interfaces with financial systems of record (GL, ERP, Payroll, Revenue Recognition).
*   **Scope of Actions:** The agent's actions are limited to organizing the inbox (labeling) and answering general FAQs. It does not have the authority or capability to execute financial transactions, modify financial statements, or alter audit trails.
*   **No Deletion Capability:** The agent does not contain logic to delete emails, meaning it does not pose a risk to document retention policies mandated by SOX Section 802.

### 3. Specific Violations of SOX
**None Found.**

Based on the provided definition and the absence of a log file indicating otherwise, there are no definitive SOX violations.
*   **Section 302/404 (Internal Controls):** The agent does not bypass financial approval workflows.
*   **Section 802 (Records Retention):** The agent creates data (labels/sent emails) but does not destroy records.
*   **Data Integrity:** The agent does not modify existing financial data.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
As the agent is currently compliant/out of scope for SOX, no remediation is required for this specific regulation.

*Note: While not a SOX violation, the "SendToGmail" node is configured with `saveAsDraft: false`. From a general risk perspective, allowing an AI to send external communications without human review is high-risk, but strictly speaking, it does not violate SOX unless the AI is authorized to make financial commitments on behalf of the company.*

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
