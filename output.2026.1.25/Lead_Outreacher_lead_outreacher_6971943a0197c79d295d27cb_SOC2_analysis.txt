ID: lead-outreacher-6971943a0197c79d295d27cb
Log file: None
Regulation: SOC2
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition, here is the SOC 2 compliance assessment.

**Note:** You referenced a `[SAMPLE_LOG]` in your prompt, but the text provided only contained the `[AGENT_DEFINITION]`. This assessment is based strictly on the logic and configuration defined in the JSON structure.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Lead Outreacher" is an automated Sales Development Representative (SDR) agent. It monitors a specific Google Sheet for new rows (containing lead PII). When a new lead is detected, it executes a linear sequence:
1.  Sends an initial cold outreach email via Gmail.
2.  Waits 3 days.
3.  Sends a follow-up email.
4.  Waits 3 days.
5.  Sends a final follow-up email.

### 2. SOC 2 Applicability
**Applicable.**
SOC 2 applies to this agent because it handles Customer Data (PII including names and emails) and performs automated business logic that impacts the user's privacy obligations. Specifically:
*   **Privacy Principle:** The agent processes personal information (PII) for outreach purposes.
*   **Processing Integrity Principle:** The agent acts autonomously to represent the business; failures in logic can result in unintended spam or harassment, violating integrity criteria.

### 3. Specific SOC 2 Violations
The following are definitive, significant violations found in the agent's logic flow:

**Violation 1: Processing Integrity (Criteria PI1.2) - Failure to Implement Logic Controls**
*   **Evidence:** The Agent Instructions state: *"Upon receiving a response, you will assess the lead’s sentiment and promptly relay it to the user."* However, the `nodes` and `edges` configuration defines a strictly linear, unconditional flow: `Email 1` -> `Wait` -> `Email 2` -> `Wait` -> `Email 3`.
*   **The Violation:** There is no "Listener," "Decision," or "Conditional" node between the wait steps to check if the user has replied.
*   **Risk:** The agent will continue to send follow-up emails (spam) even if the customer replies to the first email (e.g., "Stop," "I bought your product," or "I am interested, let's talk"). This violates Processing Integrity requirements that system processing must be accurate and meet the defined objectives. The implementation contradicts the stated instructions.

**Violation 2: Privacy (Criteria P5.2) - Lack of Consent/Choice (Opt-Out)**
*   **Evidence:** The `prompt` fields for the emails (`d1`, `d5`, `d6`) instruct the AI to write "persuasive" or "snappy" emails, but there is no instruction or configuration to include an unsubscribe link or an opt-out statement.
*   **The Violation:** SOC 2 Privacy criteria (and underlying regulations like CAN-SPAM/GDPR) require that automated communications utilizing PII provide a clear mechanism for the data subject to opt-out of further processing.
*   **Risk:** Sending three automated marketing emails without an opt-out mechanism—and without the logic to respect a "Stop" reply (see Violation 1)—is a compliance breach regarding the retention and use of personal information.

**Violation 3: Change Management / Dead Code (Criteria CC8.1)**
*   **Evidence:** The edges connect `Email 1` (`d1`) to `Cancel first timer` (`dc`), and `Email 3` (`d6`) to `Cancel second timer` (`dd`).
*   **The Violation:** This is non-functional logic. The "Cancel" nodes are triggered immediately after sending emails, but they target timers that are either not running or not correctly linked to the flow ID.
*   **Risk:** While primarily a quality issue, in a SOC 2 context, deploying code with obvious logical no-ops indicates a failure in the Change Management and Testing controls.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
1.  **Implement Conditional Logic (Critical):** The flow must be restructured. After "Wait 3 days," a check must occur: "Did the user reply?" If yes, the flow must terminate. If no, proceed to the next email.
2.  **Mandatory Opt-Out:** The system prompt for *every* email generation node must be updated to include: "Ensure the email includes a footer stating they can reply 'STOP' to unsubscribe."
3.  **Data Minimization:** Review the connection to the Google Sheet. Ensure the agent only pulls the specific columns required (Name/Email/Company) rather than the entire row, to limit PII exposure to the LLM.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Non-Compliant**

**Reasoning:** The agent presents an immediate risk of reputational damage and privacy violation. By design, it ignores customer responses and forces a 3-email sequence regardless of the recipient's feedback. This is a direct failure of Processing Integrity.
