Log file: None
Regulation: SOX
============================================================

Here is the assessment of the "Meeting Scheduler" agent regarding Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Meeting Scheduler" agent is a productivity automation tool designed to manage user calendars. It functions by monitoring emails where it is CC'd. Its primary capabilities include:
*   Scanning the user's primary calendar for free/busy availability.
*   Proposing meeting times to external or internal recipients via email.
*   Creating calendar events upon confirmation.
*   Deleting/Rescheduling events upon request.

### 2. SOX Applicability
**Verdict: Not Applicable**

**Reasoning:**
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) mandates strict reforms to existing securities regulations and imposes tough new penalties on lawbreakers. Specifically, Section 302 and Section 404 focus on **Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR)**.

To be in scope for SOX, an IT system (or agent) must:
1.  Store, process, or transmit financial data (e.g., General Ledger, Payroll, Revenue Recognition).
2.  Directly support the generation of financial statements.
3.  Provide access control or security to systems that house financial data.

The "Meeting Scheduler" agent interacts exclusively with **Email (communication)** and **Calendar (scheduling)** data. It does not have access to financial systems (ERP, HRIS, Banking), nor does it perform calculations related to financial reporting. Consequently, the risks associated with this agent are operational, not financial.

### 3. Specific Violations of SOX
**None.**

As the agent falls outside the scope of Financial Reporting and IT General Controls (ITGC) for financial systems, it cannot violate SOX regulations.

*Note regarding the "Delete event" action (Node 697192e92908dc843c114772):* While data destruction is a concern in some compliance frameworks, calendar appointments are not considered "records of original entry" for financial transactions under SOX. Therefore, the agent's ability to delete a meeting does not constitute a violation of SOX data retention or integrity rules.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
Since the agent is not applicable to SOX, no remediation is required for this specific regulatory framework.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**

*(Note: While rated Compliant, this is primarily because the agent is out of scope for the specific regulation requested.)*
