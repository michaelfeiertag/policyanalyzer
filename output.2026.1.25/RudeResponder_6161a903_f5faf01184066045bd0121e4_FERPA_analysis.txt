Agent: 6161a903-f5fa-f011-8406-6045bd0121e4
ID: 6161a903-f5fa-f011-8406-6045bd0121e4
Log file: None
Regulation: FERPA
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition (`RudeResponder`) and the instructions to assume no violations if not evident in the logs (which were referenced but not provided in the text), here is the assessment regarding FERPA compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, titled "RudeResponder," is a Microsoft Power Automate cloud flow designed to filter and auto-respond to unsolicited emails.
*   **Trigger:** It monitors the user's Office 365 inbox for new emails containing the string "marketing" in the subject line.
*   **Action:** Upon detection, it automatically sends a reply email to the original sender.
*   **Content:** The reply subject is "Re: [Original Subject]" and the body text is "Your marketing message is not appreciated."

### 2. FERPA Applicability
**Applicability:** **Low / Not Applicable**

**Reasoning:**
FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) applies to the protection of **Education Records** (records directly related to a student and maintained by an educational agency or institution).
*   **Data Scope:** This agent is explicitly configured to target emails with "marketing" in the subject line. In an enterprise or educational context, emails identified as "marketing" are typically commercial solicitations or spam, which do not constitute Education Records.
*   **Interaction:** The agent interacts with the *sender* of the email. It does not access student information systems (SIS), grade books, or transcripts.

Unless the "marketing" filter inadvertently captures an email regarding a specific student's records (e.g., "Marketing 101 Grades"), the data processed by this agent falls outside the scope of FERPA.

### 3. Specific Violations of FERPA
**Violations Found:** **None**

**Reasoning:**
Even in a worst-case hypothetical scenario where a valid Education Record is triggered (e.g., an email with the subject "Student John Doe - Marketing Class"), the agent does not violate FERPA for the following reasons:
1.  **No Third-Party Disclosure:** FERPA prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of PII to *third parties*. This agent uses the `triggerOutputs()?['body/from']` field to reply directly to the **sender**. Returning information to the party that provided it is not a disclosure violation.
2.  **No Data Persistence:** The agent definition shows no actions that save, log, or export the email content to an external database or public location.
3.  **Data Minimization:** The agent does not include the body of the original email in the response, only the subject line.

As there is no evidence in the definition that the agent forwards data to unauthorized users or exposes PII publicly, there is no FERPA violation.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **None required.** The agent is compliant with FERPA as currently defined.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Rating:** **Compliant**
