Log file: None
Regulation: FTC-Act
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition (noting that the [SAMPLE_LOG] was referenced but not included in the prompt text), here is the assessment regarding the FTC Act.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Lindy Agent Lister" is an internal administrative automation tool. Its primary function is to trigger on a recurring hourly schedule, retrieve a list of software agents existing within the user's Lindy workspace, and upsert (update or insert) this inventory data (Agent ID, Agent Name, Last Task Date) into a specific Google Sheet. It utilizes a loop to process up to 500 agents.

### 2. FTC Act Applicability
**Applicability: Low / Indirect**

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act, specifically Section 5, prohibits "unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce."
*   **Deceptive Practices:** The agent is an internal utility script. It does not interact with consumers, make marketing claims, or generate public-facing content. Therefore, it has no capacity to deceive consumers.
*   **Unfair Practices:** Unfairness usually relates to substantial consumer injury (e.g., data leaks, unauthorized billing). This agent handles internal metadata (Agent IDs and Names) rather than sensitive Consumer PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or financial data.

While the FTC Act applies to the enterprise's data security practices as a whole, this specific agent's function is operational and does not interface with the commercial market or consumer data in a way that typically triggers FTC scrutiny.

### 3. Specific Violations of FTC Act
**Violations Found: None**

Based on the provided definition:
*   There is no evidence of **Deception**: The agent does not communicate with external parties.
*   There is no evidence of **Unfairness**: The data being processed (AgentID, Agent Name, Last Task Date) is internal system metadata. There is no evidence in the definition that this agent accesses, stores, or transmits sensitive consumer data, health data, or financial information that would require specific security controls under the "Unfairness" doctrine of the FTC Act.
*   **Dead/No-oped Code:** No significant dead code was identified; the flow from Trigger -> List -> Loop -> Google Sheet Update is logically connected.

*Note: As the [SAMPLE_LOG] was not provided in the prompt text, the assessment assumes no anomalies occurred in execution, per your instructions.*

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
No remediation is required for FTC Act compliance based on the current definition.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
