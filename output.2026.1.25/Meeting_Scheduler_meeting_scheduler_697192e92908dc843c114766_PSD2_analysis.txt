Agent: meeting-scheduler-697192e92908dc843c114766
ID: meeting-scheduler-697192e92908dc843c114766
Log file: None
Regulation: PSD2
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition, here is the assessment regarding PSD2 compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Meeting Scheduler" agent acts as an automated Executive Assistant. Its primary functions are:
*   **Monitoring Email:** It listens for emails where it is CC'd (specifically looking for the prefix "scheduler").
*   **Calendar Management:** It accesses the user's calendar to check availability (`listBestTimesToScheduleEvent`), creates events (`createEvent`), and deletes events (`deleteEvent`).
*   **Communication:** It generates and sends natural language emails to negotiate meeting times with other parties.
*   **Logic:** It determines whether to search for times or book a specific slot based on the user's email intent.

### 2. PSD2 Applicability
**PSD2 is NOT applicable to this agent.**

**Reasoning:**
The Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) regulates payment services and payment service providers within the European Union. Its scope encompasses:
*   Payment Initiation Services (PIS).
*   Account Information Services (AIS) related to payment accounts (e.g., bank accounts).
*   Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) for electronic payment transactions.

This agent interacts exclusively with **Email** (LindyMail) and **Calendar** (Google Calendar/Generic Calendar) APIs. It does not:
*   Access bank account data.
*   Initiate financial transactions.
*   Aggregate financial information.
*   Act as a merchant or payment gateway.

As the agent performs purely administrative scheduling tasks and does not touch financial data or payment infrastructure, it falls completely outside the regulatory scope of PSD2.

### 3. Specific Violations of PSD2
**None.**

There is no evidence in the agent definition that it attempts to perform any regulated payment activities. The tools configured (`Calendar`, `LindyMail`) and the configuration prompts (scheduling, time zones, meeting names) are entirely unrelated to payment processing.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **No remediation is required** regarding PSD2.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**

*(Note: In this context, "Compliant" indicates that the agent does not violate the regulation because the regulation is out of scope for the agent's defined functionality.)*
