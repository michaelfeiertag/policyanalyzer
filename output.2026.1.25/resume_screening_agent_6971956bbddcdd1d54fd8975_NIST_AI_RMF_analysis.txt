ID: resume-screening-agent-6971956bbddcdd1d54fd8975
Log file: None
Regulation: NIST-AI-RMF
============================================================

Here is the compliance assessment for the "Resume Screening Agent" based on the provided Agent Definition.

**Note regarding Sample Log:** The [SAMPLE_LOG] file was referenced in your request but was not included in the provided text. This assessment relies strictly on the logic, prompts, and configuration defined in [AGENT_DEFINITION].

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Resume Screening Agent" is an automated recruitment tool designed to filter job applications.
*   **Trigger:** It activates upon receiving an email (via Gmail).
*   **Process:** It checks if the email contains a resume. It then retrieves a specific Job Description from a hardcoded Google Doc.
*   **Decision Logic:** It compares the resume against the job description using an LLM to classify the candidate into one of three categories: "Qualified," "Unqualified," or "Borderline."
*   **Output:** It automatically drafts and sends an email to the user (presumably the Hiring Manager/HR) with a summary of the candidate's fit and a recommendation.

### 2. NIST AI RMF Applicability
**Applicable: YES**

The NIST AI Risk Management Framework is highly applicable to this agent for the following reasons:
*   **High-Impact Domain (Employment):** The agent operates in the domain of employment and hiring. Decisions made or assisted by this agent directly impact individual opportunities and livelihoods. This is consistently categorized as a high-risk area in AI governance (aligned with *Map 1.5* regarding socio-technical context).
*   **Automated Decision Support:** The agent performs evaluative tasks (scoring and classification) that replace or augment human judgment.
*   **Generative Uncertainty:** The agent uses an LLM ("md" model) to interpret text and generate reasoning. This introduces risks regarding hallucination, bias, and variance which NIST AI RMF is designed to address.

### 3. Specific Violations of NIST AI RMF
Based on the provided definition, the following definitive violations of the **Map** and **Measure** functions of NIST AI RMF are present.

**A. Violation of VALIDITY and RELIABILITY (Map 2.3 / Measure 2.2)**
*   **Issue:** The agent relies on a hardcoded Google Doc link (`.../d/1h1pD3gt6XZF9-cBiTpmv2kheHOjdr0dIKNG74V4B3kc...`) to retrieve the Job Description (Node `6971956bbddcdd1d54fd8981`).
*   **Risk:** This creates a significant validity risk. If the Google Doc is edited, deleted, or if the agent is used for a *different* job opening than the one described in that specific link, the agent will screen candidates against incorrect or non-existent criteria. There is no mechanism to verify the job description matches the current context.
*   **NIST Violation:** The system lacks "mechanisms to track and maintain data provenance and lineage" and fails to ensure the system performs validly under changing contexts.

**B. Violation of FAIRNESS and BIAS MANAGEMENT (Map 1.2 / Manage 3.2)**
*   **Issue:** The prompt instructions are extremely vague: *"assign a matching score and lists the pros and cons"* and *"resume meets or exceeds the key requirements."*
*   **Risk:** There are no "guardrails" or specific rubrics provided to the AI. In hiring contexts, generic LLMs are known to exhibit bias based on names, gaps in employment, or formatting. The agent lacks specific instructions to ignore protected class attributes (age, gender, ethnicity inferred from name).
*   **NIST Violation:** Failure to manage "harmful bias and discrimination." The system does not define fairness metrics or constraints, which is critical for employment-related AI.

**C. Violation of EXPLAINABILITY and ACCOUNTABILITY (Map 3.4 / Govern 1.4)**
*   **Issue:** The logic nodes (`6971956bbddcdd1d54fd8982` and edges) make a determination of "Qualified" vs "Unqualified" based on hidden internal thresholds.
*   **Risk:** While the email *body* contains a summary, the actual *decision boundary* is opaque. There is no log of the "score" mentioned in the instructions, nor a record of *why* the model felt the threshold was met or missed.
*   **NIST Violation:** Lack of meaningful explanation for negative outcomes. If a candidate challenges a rejection, the organization cannot audit the specific logic used, as the "score" is transient and not logged.

### 4. Remediation Recommendations
To bring this agent into compliance, the following actions are required:

1.  **Dynamic Context Injection (Fix Validity):** Remove the hardcoded Google Doc link. The agent should be redesigned to either accept the Job Description as an input variable (e.g., from the body of the trigger email) or look up the correct JD based on a Job ID found in the subject line.
2.  **Standardized Scoring Rubric (Fix Fairness):** Update the system prompt to include a strict, objective scoring rubric (e.g., "Score 0-10 on Skill A, Score 0-10 on Experience B"). Explicitly instruct the model to ignore demographic data.
3.  **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) for Rejections:** Change the "Unqualified" action. Instead of sending a rejection summary immediately, the agent should flag these for human review. Automated rejection without a validated fairness audit is a high liability.
4.  **Audit Logging:** Configure the agent to log the raw analysis and the specific "score" generated by the model to a database or spreadsheet, not just the final email draft. This ensures decisions are auditable.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**NON-COMPLIANT**

**Reasoning:** This agent operates in a high-stakes environment (Hiring) with a "black box" design. It lacks essential validity checks (hardcoded data source) and fairness guardrails (vague prompts without bias mitigation). Deployment of this agent in its current state introduces significant regulatory and reputational risk.
