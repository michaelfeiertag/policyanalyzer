Agent: voice-of-the-customer-6971937b668ab8405ca92ffc
ID: voice-of-the-customer-6971937b668ab8405ca92ffc
Log file: None
Regulation: FERPA
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition and the absence of a provided Sample Log (despite the reference to one, none was included in the prompt), I have performed a strict assessment based on the active logic and configuration provided in the JSON.

Here is the assessment regarding FERPA compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Voice of the Customer" agent is designed to automate the collection of product feedback. Its workflow is as follows:
1.  **Trigger:** It monitors the calendar for `m@mftestco.com` for any event start.
2.  **Action:** It joins the meeting using the LindyMeeting tool to record and transcribe the audio.
3.  **Logic:** It determines if the meeting was a "Customer call."
4.  **Action:** If it was a customer call, it uses the **Gmail** tool (not Slack, as incorrectly stated in the description) to send an email. The email contains AI-extracted quotes regarding product feedback, competitor comparisons, and user sentiment.

### 2. FERPA Applicability
**Status: Not Applicable**

**Reasoning:**
FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) applies to educational agencies and institutions that receive funding from the U.S. Department of Education. It protects "Education Records" (records directly related to a student).

The agent definition provides definitive evidence that this workflow is **commercial**, not educational:
*   **Context:** The agent is named "Voice of the Customer."
*   **Content:** The prompt explicitly instructs the AI to extract quotes regarding "what they think of the product," "competitors," and "user calls."
*   **Identity:** The calendar ID (`mftestco.com`) implies a corporate test environment or commercial entity, not an `.edu` institution.

As the data being processed relates to commercial product feedback and customer interactions rather than student education records, FERPA regulations do not apply to this agent.

### 3. Specific Violations
**None.**

Since FERPA is not applicable to the data class described in the agent's logic (commercial product feedback), there are no violations. Even if the organization were an EdTech provider subject to FERPA, general feedback about a software product given by a school administrator (the "customer") does not constitute an "Education Record" of a student.

### 4. Remediation Recommendations
No remediation is required for FERPA compliance.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
