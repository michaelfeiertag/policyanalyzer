Agent: voice-of-the-customer-6971937b668ab8405ca92ffc
ID: voice-of-the-customer-6971937b668ab8405ca92ffc
Log file: None
Regulation: NIST-AI-RMF
============================================================

Based on the provided [AGENT_DEFINITION] and the constraints of your request, here is the assessment regarding NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0) compliance.

**Note:** You mentioned a [SAMPLE_LOG], but only the [AGENT_DEFINITION] was provided in the text. This assessment relies strictly on the logic and configuration defined in the agent's code.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, titled "Voice of the Customer," is designed to automate the collection of customer feedback. It triggers when a calendar event starts, joins the meeting via a "Lindy" bot to record and transcribe the audio, checks if it is a customer call, and attempts to extract quotes. Finally, it sends these quotes via email (Gmail) to a specified recipient.

### 2. NIST AI RMF Applicability
**Status: Applicable**
The NIST AI RMF applies to this agent because:
*   **Generative Capability:** The system utilizes an LLM (Model: "md") to synthesize, summarize, and modify human speech ("extract noteworthy quotes," "slightly change it").
*   **High-Impact Data Processing:** The agent processes sensitive data (voice recordings, PII, internal communications) which impacts the **Privacy** and **Security** characteristics of the framework.
*   **Decision Making:** The agent makes autonomous decisions on what constitutes a "noteworthy" quote and modifies the content before dissemination.

### 3. Specific Violations of NIST AI RMF

Based on the definition provided, the following significant violations were identified:

**A. Violation of Integrity and Validity (Map 2.3, Manage 2.4)**
*   **Issue:** The prompt configuration in the Gmail node explicitly instructs the AI to: *"feel free to slightly change it from what the person exactly said... removing repeated words or grammar mistakes."*
*   **NIST Context:** NIST AI RMF requires AI systems to maintain information integrity. By definition, a "quote" represents a verbatim record. Instructing the AI to alter the input data while presenting it as a direct quote ("Noteworthy quote(s)...") constitutes data fabrication and misrepresentation. In a compliance context, attributing altered words to a customer creates significant legal and reputational risk.

**B. Violation of Reliability and Trustworthiness (Measure 2.2)**
*   **Issue:** The agent's `description` states it sends quotes *"to your team on Slack."* However, the actual logic (Node `6971937b668ab8405ca93008`) is hardcoded to use the **Gmail** tool.
*   **NIST Context:** Reliability requires that an AI system performs as described and expected by the operator. The discrepancy between the stated function (Slack) and the executed function (Email) renders the system unreliable and the documentation inaccurate.

**C. Violation of Transparency (Map 1.2, Manage 1.3)**
*   **Issue:** In the `Record meeting` node, the configuration `includeLindyLogo` is manually set to `false`.
*   **NIST Context:** Transparency requires that stakeholders (meeting attendees) are aware they are interacting with or being recorded by an AI system. While the bot name is "Team's Lindy Assistant," explicitly disabling the visual indicator (logo) obfuscates the nature of the participant, reducing transparency during data collection.

### 4. Remediation Recommendations

1.  **Enforce Verbatim Integrity:** Modify the prompt in the Gmail node. Remove the instruction to "change it from what the person exactly said." Explicitly instruct the model to "Extract quotes verbatim. Do not alter words or grammar." If summarization is required, label the output as "Summary" rather than "Quotes."
2.  **Align Description and Function:** Update the agent description to reflect that it sends emails, or change the action node to the Slack tool to match the description.
3.  **Enhance Transparency:** Change the `includeLindyLogo` configuration to `true`. Ensure the bot announces itself or provides a visual cue that it is an automated recording agent.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating

**Rating: Non-Compliant**

The agent is **Non-Compliant** primarily due to the **Integrity** violation. The explicit instruction to alter customer quotes while presenting them as fact introduces unacceptable risk to data validity and organizational trust, which contradicts the core tenets of the NIST AI RMF.
