ID: seo-blog-writer-6971952e930a41d9e2623ea7
Log file: None
Regulation: FERPA
============================================================

Here is the assessment regarding FERPA compliance for the "SEO Blog Writer" agent.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "SEO Blog Writer" is a marketing automation agent designed to generate long-form, search-engine-optimized content. Its workflow involves:
*   Accepting user inputs regarding topics, target audiences, and brand voice.
*   utilizing Perplexity (an external AI search tool) to analyze specific websites and research keywords.
*   Generating a 1500+ word blog post.
*   Outputting the article along with meta descriptions and formatting notes to the user.

### 2. FERPA Applicability
**Verdict: Not Applicable**

**Reasoning:**
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) governs the privacy of student "Education Records" (e.g., grades, transcripts, disciplinary records, class schedules) maintained by educational agencies or institutions.

This agent is explicitly defined and configured for **marketing and public content creation**. The input parameters (keywords, brand voice, website links) and the output data (blog posts, meta descriptions) do not constitute Education Records. The agent does not request, process, store, or transmit Personally Identifiable Information (PII) related to students or academic performance. Therefore, the regulatory framework of FERPA does not apply to the intrinsic function of this agent.

### 3. Specific Violations of FERPA
**Verdict: None Found**

**Reasoning:**
*   **No Access to Education Records:** The agent's tools (`Perplexity`) are configured to search the public web (`model: sonar`), not internal student databases or Student Information Systems (SIS).
*   **No PII Retention:** The agent state (`SEO Content Creation`) is transient and focuses on generating generic marketing text.
*   **No Unauthorized Disclosure:** As the agent does not ingest student data, it cannot improperly disclose it.

*Note: The trigger listing contains a "Unknown" tool/action (ID: `6971952e930a41d9e2623eac`). This appears to be dead/no-oped code and does not alter the data flow or compliance posture.*

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
No remediation is required for FERPA compliance. The agent functions outside the scope of student data privacy regulations.

*   **Standard Operational Note:** While not a remediation for this specific agent, ensure standard enterprise policy prohibits users from manually pasting student PII into the "Target topic" or "Specific points" input fields, as this agent processes data via external third-party models (Perplexity).

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
