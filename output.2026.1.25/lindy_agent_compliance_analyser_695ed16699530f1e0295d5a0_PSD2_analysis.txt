Log file: None
Regulation: PSD2
============================================================

Based on the review of the [AGENT_DEFINITION] provided, here is the assessment regarding PSD2 compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Lindy Agent Compliance Analyser" agent performs a looping operation. For each item in an input list, it executes a JavaScript code block to encode an ID (converting a raw ID into a Base64 GraphQL Global ID). It then uses this ID to execute a complex HTTP POST request (GraphQL query) to the Lindy API. This query retrieves extensive metadata about the user's workspace, including agent definitions, task lists, and **internal billing information** (specifically subscription plans, credit allocations, credit balances, and trial expiration dates).

### 2. PSD2 Applicability
**PSD2 is NOT Applicable.**

**Reasoning:**
The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) regulates Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and governs access to **payment accounts** (e.g., bank accounts, credit card transaction history) held at financial institutions.

While the agent retrieves data labeled `billingInfo`, `creditBalance`, and `subscriptionPlan`, an analysis of the GraphQL query structure confirms this data refers to **SaaS service credits** (internal platform usage tokens) and subscription tier metadata within the Lindy platform. It does not access, aggregate, or initiate transactions regarding monetary funds held in a regulated payment account (such as a bank IBAN or credit card statement). As the agent is not acting as a Third Party Provider (TPP) accessing banking APIs (Open Banking), PSD2 regulations do not apply to this workflow.

### 3. Specific Violations of PSD2
**No PSD2 violations found.**

As the directive is not applicable to the retrieval of internal SaaS configuration and service-credit usage data, no specific articles of the PSD2 RTS (Regulatory Technical Standards) are violated.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **No remediation required regarding PSD2.**

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
