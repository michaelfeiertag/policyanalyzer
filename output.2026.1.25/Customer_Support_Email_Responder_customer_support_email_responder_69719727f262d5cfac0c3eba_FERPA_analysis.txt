ID: customer-support-email-responder-69719727f262d5cfac0c3eba
Log file: None
Regulation: FERPA
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition and the instructions to avoid speculation and rely only on evidence, here is the assessment regarding FERPA compliance.

**Note on Sample Log:** The prompt references a `[SAMPLE_LOG]`, but only the `[AGENT_DEFINITION]` JSON was provided in the input. This assessment is based strictly on the agent's structural definition.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Customer Support Email Responder" is an automated workflow designed to handle incoming emails via Gmail. Its process is as follows:
1.  **Trigger:** Detects a new email in a specific Gmail inbox.
2.  **Action:** Searches a connected "Knowledge Base" for information relevant to the email content.
3.  **Logic:** Determines if an answer was found in the Knowledge Base.
4.  **Action:** If an answer is found, it uses an LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to draft a reply.
    *   **Control:** The email is explicitly configured to `saveAsDraft` (value: `true`), requiring human review before sending.

### 2. FERPA Applicability
**Verdict: Not Applicable**

**Reasoning:**
FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) applies specifically to "Education Records" held by educational agencies or institutions (schools, universities) that receive funding from the U.S. Department of Education.

*   **Context:** The agent is explicitly defined as a "Customer Support" tool for a "company" to query a "company knowledge base."
*   **Data Types:** There is no evidence in the definition that this agent processes student transcripts, grades, disciplinary records, or class schedules.
*   **Target Audience:** The definition refers to "customers," not "students."

Unless this agent is specifically deployed by an educational institution to handle student records (which is not indicated in the definition), FERPA regulations do not apply to this workflow.

### 3. Specific Violations of FERPA
**Verdict: None Found**

Even if we hypothetically assume the "Enterprise" is a University and the "Customers" are students, no definitive violations are present in the code:

*   **No Unauthorized Disclosure:** The agent does not publish data publicly. It replies only to the sender (`replyTo: "all"`).
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** The configuration `saveAsDraft: true` ensures that no AI-generated content is sent automatically. A human agent must review and send the email, acting as the final compliance filter.
*   **Restricted Data Source:** The prompt instructs the AI to "Only answer via knowledge that you found in your knowledge base." This limits the AI from hallucinating or leaking private data not already approved in the KB.

### 4. Remediation Recommendations
No remediation is necessary as the agent is compliant.

*   **Advisory Note:** If this agent is later repurposed for an educational environment, ensure the connected "Knowledge Base" does not contain unredacted PII (Personally Identifiable Information) of students, such as grade rosters or social security numbers.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
