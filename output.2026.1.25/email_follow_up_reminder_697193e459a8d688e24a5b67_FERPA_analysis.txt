Agent: email-follow-up-reminder-697193e459a8d688e24a5b67
ID: email-follow-up-reminder-697193e459a8d688e24a5b67
Log file: None
Regulation: FERPA
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition (and noting that the [SAMPLE_LOG] was not included in the prompt, forcing an assessment based strictly on the definition and the instruction to assume no violation in the absence of evidence), here is the FERPA compliance assessment.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Email Follow-up Reminder" agent integrates with a user's Gmail account. It monitors outgoing sent emails to determine if they require a response. If the AI determines a response is needed, the agent waits for a configured period (3 days). If no response is detected from the recipient within that timeframe, the agent utilizes an LLM to generate a one-sentence follow-up message. This message is saved as a **draft** in the user's Gmail account; it is not sent automatically. Although the greeting message mentions Slack notifications, the active logic nodes contain no Slack integration, limiting actions strictly to Gmail.

### 2. FERPA Applicability
**Applicable.**
FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) applies if this agent is deployed within an educational agency or institution (or by a party acting on their behalf) and the email account being monitored transmits "Education Records" (grades, student schedules, disciplinary records, or PII). Given the broad trigger (`onGmailMessageSent`), the agent processes *all* outgoing email content. If the user is a school official, it is highly probable that student data will pass through this agent.

### 3. Specific Violations of FERPA
**None Found.**
Based on the provided definition, there are no definitive FERPA violations.
*   **No Unauthorized Disclosure:** The agent does not share data with third parties outside of the standard processing loop. The output is directed back to the original user's account as a "Draft."
*   **Controlled Output:** The configuration explicitly sets `"saveAsDraft": true`. This ensures a human "school official" must review and manually send the email, maintaining direct control over the release of any information.
*   **Contextual Integrity:** The agent replies to the existing thread (`"replyTo": "all"`). It does not introduce new, unauthorized recipients to the conversation.

*Note: The greeting message claims the agent will "notify you on Slack." However, the actual logic nodes (`nodes`) and connections (`edges`) do not contain any Slack tools or actions. This is treated as dead code/hallucinated description and presents no data leakage risk.*

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **None Required:** The agent logic functions within the boundaries of the user's authenticated session and does not autonomously expose data.
*   *Advisory:* Ensure that the underlying Enterprise agreement with the LLM provider (Lindy) includes a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) acknowledging the "School Official" exception, ensuring that data processed by the AI model is not used for model training or shared externally.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**
