Agent: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
ID: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
Log file: None
Regulation: ISO27001
============================================================

Here is the assessment of the agent "Board meeting monitor" based on the provided definition and ISO 27001 standards.

**Note regarding Sample Log:** The prompt referenced a `[SAMPLE_LOG]` but only the `[AGENT_DEFINITION]` was provided. Per your instructions ("If there is no evidence of a violation assume there is none"), this assessment is based strictly on the architectural risks and configurations defined in the JSON code.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent is a scheduled automation designed to monitor a corporate calendar for sensitive events.
*   **Triggers:** Runs twice daily (9:00 AM and 6:00 PM).
*   **Input:** Queries the calendar for "board meetings" occurring the next day.
*   **Logic:**
    *   In the morning, it attempts to send details via **Gmail** to `m@testco.com`.
    *   In the evening (afternoon), it attempts to send details via **Twilio SMS** to `+14155312776`.

### 2. ISO 27001 Applicability
**Applicable.**
ISO 27001 is highly applicable to this agent because it processes **Board Level Information**. In terms of Information Classification (a requirement of ISO 27001, A.5.12), Board meetings and their agendas represent "Confidential" or "Restricted" information. The disclosure of the existence, timing, or content of board meetings can have material impacts on the organization. Consequently, the controls regarding the access, transfer, and protection of this data are critical.

### 3. Specific Violations of ISO 27001
Based on the definition provided, the following definitive violation is identified:

**Violation: A.5.14 - Information Transfer (and A.8.2)**
*   **Evidence:** The agent is configured to transmit Board meeting data via the `Twilio` node (Action ID: `693b38d0bd61ebac9988a2ee`) using SMS.
*   **Reasoning:** SMS (Short Message Service) is an unencrypted transport protocol (cleartext over the air interface) and is vulnerable to interception and SIM-swapping attacks. ISO 27001 requires that information transfer rules be established proportional to the sensitivity of the data. Transmitting "Board meeting" details (High Sensitivity) via SMS (Low Security) violates the principle of protecting information confidentiality during transport.

*Note on Gmail:* The email transfer to `m@testco.com` is likely compliant assuming `testco.com` is the organization's managed domain and standard TLS encryption is enforced by the provider. The violation is specifically isolated to the SMS channel.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
1.  **Remove the Twilio/SMS Node:** Disable or delete the logic branch that sends Board data via SMS.
2.  **Unify Communication Channels:** Route the evening notification through the secure corporate email channel (`m@testco.com`) or a secure, end-to-end encrypted enterprise messaging tool (e.g., Slack/Teams) that integrates with the organization's Identity and Access Management (IAM).
3.  **Review Recipient Authorization:** Verify that the owner of `+14155312776` and `m@testco.com` is authorized to view the schedule of **all** board meetings found by the query, to ensure compliance with the Principle of Least Privilege.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Non-Compliant**

*The use of SMS to transmit Board-level data represents a significant failure of Information Transfer controls.*
