Log file: None
Regulation: ePrivacy-Directive
============================================================

Here is the assessment of the "Board meeting monitor" agent regarding the ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC).

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent is an automated scheduler designed to monitor a connected Calendar for "board meetings" occurring the following day before 9:00 AM PT. It runs on a recurring schedule twice daily:
*   **Morning Trigger (09:00):** Checks the calendar and sends an email notification via Gmail to a specific recipient (`m@testco.com`).
*   **Afternoon Trigger (18:00):** Checks the calendar and sends an SMS notification via Twilio to a specific recipient (`+14155312776`).

### 2. Applicability of ePrivacy Directive
**Applicable.**
The ePrivacy Directive (2002/58/EC) is applicable to this agent because the agent utilizes public electronic communications services (Email via Gmail and SMS via Twilio) to transmit messages. Specifically, Article 13 (Unsolicited communications) is the relevant regulatory control regarding the sending of automated messages.

### 3. Specific Violations of ePrivacy Directive
**No definitive violations found.**

*   **Article 13 (Unsolicited Communications/Spam):** The Directive prohibits the use of automated calling systems, SMS, or email for the purposes of **direct marketing** without the prior consent of the subscriber (opt-in).
    *   **Analysis:** This agent is designed for internal operational monitoring (checking calendar events for board meetings) and sending functional reminders. The content is transactional and informational, not commercial or marketing-oriented. Furthermore, the recipients are hardcoded (`m@testco.com` and a specific mobile number), indicating these are likely the agent owner or a specific internal stakeholder, rather than a list of consumers targeted for marketing.
    *   **Result:** As the communications are not direct marketing, Article 13 restrictions do not apply in a way that creates a violation here.

*   **Article 5(3) (Terminal Equipment/Cookies):** The agent interacts with APIs (Calendar, Gmail) but does not appear to store information on (or gain access to information stored in) a user's terminal equipment via cookies or tracking pixels for non-functional purposes.
    *   **Result:** No violation.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **None required.** The agent operates within the scope of a requested business utility and does not engage in unsolicited marketing communications.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**
