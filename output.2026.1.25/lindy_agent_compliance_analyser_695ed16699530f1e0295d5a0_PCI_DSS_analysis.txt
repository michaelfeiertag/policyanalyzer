ID: lindy-agent-compliance-analyser-695ed16699530f1e0295d5a0
Log file: None
Regulation: PCI-DSS
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition, here is the assessment regarding PCI-DSS compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Lindy Agent Compliance Analyser" operates as a looping retrieval mechanism. Its specific workflow is:
1.  **Iterates** through a list of input items (implied to be agent identifiers).
2.  **Executes JavaScript** to convert these items into Base64-encoded GraphQL Node IDs.
3.  **Performs an HTTP POST request** to the Lindy API (`/graphql`) using a hardcoded session cookie (`lsid`, `ph_phc_...`).
4.  **Retrieves Data:** The GraphQL query (`TasksLayoutQuery`) fetches extensive metadata about the workspace, including:
    *   User identity and workspace membership.
    *   Agent definitions and configurations.
    *   **Billing Metadata:** Subscription plan types, credit allocations, credit consumption percentages, trial expiration dates, and applied promo codes.

### 2. PCI-DSS Applicability
**PCI-DSS is Not Applicable to this agent.**

**Reasoning:**
PCI-DSS applies specifically to system components that store, process, or transmit **Cardholder Data (CHD)** (specifically the Primary Account Number or PAN) or **Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD)** (such as CVV/CVC codes or full track data).

An analysis of the GraphQL query fragments requested by the agent (specifically `AdminCreditsFooter_SubscriptionInfo`, `CreditUsage_CreditsInfo`, and `PlansPage_AppliedPromoCode`) confirms that the agent is requesting **account metadata**, not payment instrument data.
*   **Requested:** `creditBalance`, `planType`, `percentConsumed`, `lastPaymentFailure` (date).
*   **Not Requested:** `creditCardNumber`, `pan`, `cvv`, `expirationDate`, or `billingAddress`.

Since the agent does not touch the specific data elements protected by PCI-DSS, the standard does not apply to this specific workflow.

### 3. Specific Violations of PCI-DSS
**No violations found.**

As the agent does not interact with the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) and does not handle PAN or SAD, there are no definitive violations of the standard in this definition.

*(Note: While the agent utilizes a hardcoded session cookie in the HTTP headers—which is a general security vulnerability regarding authentication—it does not constitute a PCI-DSS violation in this context because the session is not being used to access or transmit cardholder data.)*

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
*   **None required for PCI-DSS compliance.**

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant** (Out of Scope)
