Agent: Email Triager
ID: email-triager-697196b1971478a22c30ccbe
Log file: None
Regulation: COPPA
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition (`[AGENT_DEFINITION]`), here is the assessment regarding COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) compliance.

### 1. Summary of the Agent's Function
The **Email Triager** is a productivity automation tool designed to manage a Gmail inbox. Its primary workflow involves:
*   **Monitoring:** Listening for incoming emails via the `onGmailMessageReceived` trigger.
*   **Classification:** Analyzing email content to categorize messages as "Important," "Newsletter," "Spam," or "Customer FAQ."
*   **Action:**
    *   Applying specific Gmail labels based on the category.
    *   For "Customer FAQ" emails, the agent queries a Knowledge Base and automatically sends a reply to the sender.

### 2. COPPA Applicability
**Verdict: COPPA is NOT Applicable.**

**Reasoning:**
1.  **Not Directed to Children:** The agent is explicitly designed as a business or personal productivity tool ("Organize your inbox," "Customer FAQ," "Sales outreach"). The subject matter, visual elements (inferred from the configuration), and language are directed at general adult audiences or enterprise users, not children under the age of 13.
2.  **No Actual Knowledge:** The agent's trigger (`Gmail.onGmailMessageReceived`) collects the sender's email address (`from`) and body content to perform its function. However, the agent definition shows no mechanism for requesting age verification, birth dates, or identifying that a specific sender is a child.
3.  **General Audience Service:** Under COPPA, a service directed to a general audience is only liable if the operator has "actual knowledge" that they are collecting personal information from a child. There is nothing in this configuration to suggest the agent filters for or identifies children.

### 3. Specific Violations of COPPA
**No COPPA violations found.**

*   The agent collects email addresses (Personal Information), but this collection is incidental to a general audience service.
*   There is no data collection flow that targets children.
*   There is no persistent tracking (cookies/identifiers) used for behavioral advertising directed at children mentioned in this configuration.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
Since the agent is compliant and COPPA is not applicable, no remediation is required regarding child privacy.

*   **General Best Practice (Non-COPPA):** While not a COPPA violation, ensure the `Customer FAQ` auto-response (Node ID `697196b1971478a22c30cccb`) includes a disclaimer that the reply was generated by an AI, to maintain transparency with all general audience senders.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

*The agent functions as a general business utility. Unless the specific email address this agent monitors is marketed directly to children (e.g., `kids-club@enterprise.com`), this software configuration introduces no COPPA regulatory risk.*
