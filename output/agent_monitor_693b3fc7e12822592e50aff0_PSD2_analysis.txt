Log file: None
Regulation: PSD2
============================================================

Based on the review of the provided [AGENT_DEFINITION], here is the regulatory compliance assessment regarding PSD2.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **Agent Monitor** is an internal observability and logging automation tool. Its specific workflow is:
1.  **Triggers:** It listens for the successful completion of tasks from three specific other agents: "Brand Monitor," "Recruiting," and "Board Meeting Monitor."
2.  **Process:** When one of these agents completes a task, the Agent Monitor fetches the specific execution details (inputs, outputs, and metadata) using the `Lindy.getTaskDetails` utility.
3.  **Output:** It appends a single row containing this metadata (Timestamp, Agent Name, Inputs, Outputs, etc.) into a specific Google Sheet titled "Lindy Monitoring Events."

### 2. PSD2 Applicability
**Verdict: Not Applicable**

The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) regulates Payment Service Providers (PSPs), Account Information Service Providers (AISPs), and Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) within the European Economic Area.

PSD2 is **not applicable** to this agent for the following reasons:
*   **No Financial Interaction:** The agent does not interact with banking APIs, payment gateways, or financial institutions.
*   **No Payment Functionality:** The agent does not initiate payments, transfer funds, or process transactions.
*   **No Account Access:** The agent does not retrieve account balances or transaction history from financial institutions for the purpose of aggregation (Open Banking).
*   **Nature of Data:** The agent monitors operational workflows ("Recruiting," "Brand Monitor"). While these workflows might incidentally contain business data, the Agent Monitor acts strictly as a logger of internal system events, not as a financial intermediary.

### 3. Specific PSD2 Violations
**None.**

As the directive is not applicable to the function of this agent, there are no violations of PSD2 articles regarding Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), dynamic linking, or secure communication standards with financial institutions.

### 4. Remediation Recommendations
No remediation is required regarding PSD2.

*General Security Note (Non-PSD2):*
While not a PSD2 violation, the agent is authenticated with Google scopes that are significantly broader than necessary for its function. It possesses scopes for `gmail.send`, `drive` (full access), and `calendar`, yet only uses `spreadsheets`. To reduce general security risk (violation of Least Privilege), the Google authentication scopes should be restricted to `spreadsheets` only.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

*The agent operates outside the regulatory perimeter of PSD2.*
