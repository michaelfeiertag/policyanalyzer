Agent: AI CMO | Research Agent
ID: ai-cmo-research-agent-697194e773107647553ffb5a
Log file: None
Regulation: PCI-DSS
============================================================

Based on the review of the [AGENT_DEFINITION] provided, here is the assessment regarding PCI-DSS compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **AI CMO | Research Agent** functions as an automated marketing researcher. Its workflow involves:
*   Accepting a company URL from the user.
*   Scraping the provided website for public business information (value proposition, products, tone).
*   Using an external LLM/Search tool (Perplexity) to identify competitors and conduct market research.
*   Generating marketing strategy artifacts (User Personas, Journey Maps, USP, etc.).
*   **Creating Google Documents** to store this research and outputting links to the user.

### 2. PCI-DSS Applicability
**Verdict: Not Applicable**

PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) applies strictly to entities that store, process, or transmit **Cardholder Data (CHD)** (e.g., Primary Account Numbers, CVV codes) or **Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD)**.

*   **No Collection:** The agent's input variables (`site_url`) and prompts are designed solely to ingest public web addresses and business descriptions. There is no mechanism or solicitation for payment information.
*   **No Processing:** The logic flows (web scraping, LLM summarization, document creation) process public marketing data and business intelligence.
*   **No Transmission:** The agent does not interact with payment gateways, merchant IDs, or financial databases.

### 3. Specific PCI-DSS Violations
**None Found.**

Based on the provided definition, the agent operates entirely outside the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE). It interacts with public web data and internal Google Drive APIs. There are no instances of:
*   Unencrypted transmission of PAN (Requirement 4).
*   Storage of sensitive authentication data (Requirement 3).
*   Insecure access control to card data (Requirement 7).

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
While there are no PCI-DSS remediation steps required, the following **General Security Recommendation** is critical based on the configuration found in the definition:

*   **Critical Data Leakage Fix (Non-PCI):**
    *   **Issue:** Multiple `GoogleDocs.create` nodes (e.g., Node ID `697194e773107647553ffb78`, `697194e773107647553ffb7c`) are configured with the `sharingPreference` set to **"Anyone with the link can edit"**.
    *   **Risk:** This creates publicly writable documents accessible by anyone who guesses or intercepts the URL. While this is not a PCI violation (as the docs contain marketing data, not credit card numbers), it is a severe data security misconfiguration.
    *   **Recommendation:** Change the `sharingPreference` in all Google Docs nodes to **"Private (only me)"** or **"Anyone in my organization can view"**.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT (Not Applicable)**

*The agent does not interact with PCI-regulated data. Therefore, it does not violate the standard.*
