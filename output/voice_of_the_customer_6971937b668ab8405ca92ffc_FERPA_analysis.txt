Agent: Voice of the Customer22 minutes ago
ID: voice-of-the-customer-6971937b668ab8405ca92ffc
Log file: None
Regulation: FERPA
============================================================

Based on the review of the [AGENT_DEFINITION] provided, here is the FERPA compliance assessment.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
**Agent Name:** Voice of the Customer
**ID:** `6971937b668ab8405ca92ffc`

This agent automates the collection of product feedback from meetings. Its workflow is as follows:
1.  **Trigger:** Detects the start of a calendar event (Google Calendar) for the user `m@mftestco.com`.
2.  **Recording:** Joins the meeting using the "Lindy meeting recorder" to record audio and generate a transcript.
3.  **Logic Filter:** Evaluates if the meeting was a "Customer call."
4.  **Distribution:** If it was a customer call, it uses an LLM to extract "noteworthy quotes" about the product (good/bad feedback, competitor comparisons) and sends these quotes via **Gmail** to a specified list.
    *   *Note:* The agent description claims it sends to Slack, but the actual configuration (`ActionNode` ID `...3008`) is configured to use the **Gmail** tool.

### 2. FERPA Applicability
**Verdict: NOT APPLICABLE**

**Reasoning:**
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) applies to **educational agencies and institutions** that receive funding from the U.S. Department of Education. It specifically protects the privacy of **student education records**.

*   **Context:** The agent is deployed in a commercial "Large Enterprise" context (indicated by your role and the email domain `mftestco.com`).
*   **Data Subject:** The agent targets "Customers" and "User calls," not "Students."
*   **Data Content:** The agent extracts product feedback ("what they think of the product"), not "Education Records" (grades, transcripts, disciplinary records, class schedules).

Unless your enterprise is an EdTech company acting as a "school official" with a legitimate educational interest *and* the specific "customers" being recorded are students discussing their academic records, FERPA regulations do not apply to this activity.

### 3. Specific FERPA Violations
**None Found.**

As the regulation is not applicable to commercial product feedback collection, there are no violations of FERPA statutes.

*Even if* the organization were an educational institution:
1.  **Directory Information:** Recording a conversation is not inherently a FERPA violation.
2.  **Legitimate Interest:** Sharing product feedback within the organization likely falls under operational legitimate interest, provided specific PII regarding a student's academic standing is not disclosed to unauthorized parties.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
While there are no FERPA violations, the following security and governance recommendations are relevant to the risk profile:

1.  **Privacy/Consent (General Risk):** Ensure that the recording of "customers" complies with state-level wiretapping laws (One-party vs. Two-party consent). The agent enters the meeting as a bot ("Voice of the Customer"), which usually serves as notice, but this should be verified against your legal team's recording policy.
2.  **Description Mismatch:** The agent description states it sends data to **Slack**, but the configuration explicitly sends data via **Gmail**. This creates a transparency risk. The description should be updated to match the actual behavior.
3.  **Data Leakage Prevention:** Review the recipient list for the Gmail action. Ensure the "team" receiving these quotes is internal only. The configuration leaves the `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` fields as manual inputs or defaults that should be verified to prevent external leakage of customer data.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**RATING: COMPLIANT**

The agent does not process Education Records as defined by law and therefore does not violate FERPA.
