Agent: Email Follow-up Reminder20 minutes ago
ID: email-follow-up-reminder-697193e459a8d688e24a5b67
Log file: None
Regulation: PSD2
============================================================

Based on the analysis of the provided Agent Definition and configuration, here is the assessment regarding PSD2 compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, titled "Email Follow-up Reminder," is an automated productivity tool designed to integrate with a user's Gmail account. Its specific workflow is:
*   **Trigger:** It monitors the "Sent" folder of the connected Gmail account (`onGmailMessageSent`).
*   **Logic:** It uses an LLM to determine if the sent email requires a response.
*   **Action:** If a response is required, it waits for a specific duration (configured as 3 days/4320 minutes).
*   **Check:** It checks if a reply has been received.
*   **Result:** If no reply is detected, it generates a draft follow-up email (`SendToGmail` with `saveAsDraft: true`) in the user's Gmail account for manual review and sending.

### 2. PSD2 Applicability
**PSD2 is NOT Applicable.**

**Reasoning:**
The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) regulates Payment Service Providers (PSPs), Account Information Service Providers (AISPs), and Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) within the EU/EEA. It specifically governs the access to payment accounts (XS2A) and the processing of financial transactions.

*   **No Financial Data Access:** This agent accesses Google Workspace data (Gmail, Calendar, Drive). It does not access banking APIs, checking accounts, credit card ledgers, or payment gateways.
*   **No Payment Initiation:** The agent creates email drafts. It does not initiate funds transfers, authorize payments, or manage direct debits.
*   **No "Payment Account" Definition:** A Gmail account is not a "payment account" as defined under Article 4(12) of PSD2.

### 3. Specific Violations of PSD2
**No violations found.**

As the regulation does not apply to the scope of this agent's operation (email automation and document processing), it cannot violate the directive. The agent operates entirely outside the regulatory perimeter of PSD2.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
Regarding PSD2, no remediation is required.

*   **General Security Note (Non-PSD2):** While not a PSD2 violation, the agent requests broad OAuth scopes (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`) that appear unused in the logic flow described (which focuses strictly on Gmail). From a general "Least Privilege" security posture, these scopes should be removed if the agent does not actually manipulate Drive files, but this poses no regulatory risk under PSD2.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

*The agent is Compliant because the specific regulation (PSD2) is not applicable to its defined function and scope.*
