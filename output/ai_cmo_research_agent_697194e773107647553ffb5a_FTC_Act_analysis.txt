Agent: AI CMO | Research Agent
ID: ai-cmo-research-agent-697194e773107647553ffb5a
Log file: None
Regulation: FTC-Act
============================================================

Based on the review of the [AGENT_DEFINITION] provided, here is the security and compliance assessment regarding the FTC Act.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **AI CMO | Research Agent** is a business intelligence automation tool designed to conduct market research and formulate brand strategy. Its workflow is as follows:
1.  **Ingestion:** Accepts a company URL from the user.
2.  **Analysis:** Scrapes the target website to identify the company's identity, industry, and existing messaging.
3.  **Competitor Research:** Uses Perplexity (`sonar-deep-research` and `sonar-reasoning-pro` models) to identify top competitors, scrape their data, and analyze their market positioning.
4.  **Strategy Generation:** Uses LLMs (specifically referenced as `gpt5` in the config) to generate derivative strategic assets, including Customer Personas, Value Propositions, Unique Selling Points (USPs), and Customer Journey Maps.
5.  **Output:** Compiles this information into multiple Google Docs (Competitor Analysis, Research Report, Brand Guidelines, etc.) and shares the links with the user.

### 2. FTC Act Applicability
**Applicable.**
The FTC Act (Section 5) prohibits "unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce."
*   **Deception:** Applies to the accuracy of the marketing materials, USPs, and claims the agent generates. If the agent generates false or unsubstantiated claims that the user subsequently publishes, this creates liability.
*   **Unfairness:** Applies to how the agent gathers data (scraping) and how it handles potential consumer data during its research phase.
*   **AI Conduct:** The FTC has explicitly stated that AI tools used to generate marketing content must not produce misleading claims, and the entity deploying the tool is responsible for the output.

### 3. Assessment of Violations
**No definitive, significant violations found.**

Upon reviewing the node configuration and logic flow, the agent does not perform actions that constitute a direct violation of the FTC Act.

*   **No Auto-Publishing:** The agent generates drafts and saves them to private Google Docs (Nodes `697194e7...fb78`, `...fb7c`, etc.). It does not automatically post to social media, buy ads, or publish content to the public web. Therefore, it does not directly deceive consumers.
*   **Verification Mechanisms Included:** The agent specifically includes a "Human-in-the-loop" step (Node `697194e7...fb75`) where it lists the identified competitors and asks the user: *"List out the three competitors and ask the user if they are accurate."* This mitigates the risk of hallucination-based deception.
*   **Internal Research Scope:** The agent is designed for internal business intelligence (Strategy, Personas, Research), which is not a consumer-facing commercial practice regulated under "deceptive advertising" provisions until that data is used externally.
*   **No Unfair Data Collection:** The agent uses standard search and scraping (Perplexity and Browser tools) to access publicly available web data. There is no evidence in the configuration of it bypassing authentication walls, harvesting sensitive personal data, or engaging in "commercial surveillance" that the FTC deems unfair.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
While the agent itself is compliant, the *outputs* it produces create downstream risk if used improperly by your employees.

1.  **Mandatory Disclaimer in Output Docs:** Modify the prompt for the Google Doc creation nodes (e.g., Node `697194e7...fb8e`) to append a standard footer: *"Generated by AI. All marketing claims, pricing, and competitive comparisons must be verified for accuracy before public distribution to ensure compliance with federal advertising regulations."*
2.  **Hallucination Check for "Features" Node:** In Node `697194e7...fb89` ("Company Messaging x Features"), the agent asks the LLM to identify core features. If the LLM hallucinates a feature the product does not actually have, and this is pasted into a live ad, it is a Section 5 violation. Add a logic step requiring user confirmation of the *features list* similar to the existing *competitor list* confirmation.
3.  **Logo/IP Usage:** In Node `697194e7...fb8b` ("Brand Research"), the agent fetches logo URLs. Ensure internal policy dictates that these assets are used for internal comparison only, not for public comparative advertising without legal review, to avoid trade dress or unfair competition claims.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

The agent functions as a drafting and research assistant. It operates within a "human-in-the-loop" workflow and does not autonomously engage in commerce or public-facing advertising. The architectural risk of violating the FTC Act is negligible provided the user reviews the generated documents.
