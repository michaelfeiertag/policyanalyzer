Log file: None
Regulation: PSD2
============================================================

Based on the review of the provided [AGENT_DEFINITION] for the agent "Board meeting monitor" (ID: 693b3789c8b9204305fd5087), here is the assessment regarding PSD2 (Payment Services Directive 2) compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent is an automated scheduler designed to monitor a Google Calendar for specific events. Its workflow is as follows:
*   **Triggers:** The agent activates twice daily (9:00 AM and 6:00 PM) based on a recurring schedule.
*   **Data Retrieval:** It accesses Google Calendar to search for "board meetings" occurring the next day before 9:00 AM PT.
*   **Logic & Output:**
    *   If triggered in the morning, it sends an email summary via Gmail to a specific recipient (`m@testco.com`).
    *   If triggered in the afternoon, it sends an SMS notification via Twilio to a specific phone number.

### 2. PSD2 Applicability
**PSD2 is NOT Applicable.**

**Reasoning:**
The Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) regulates Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and Third-Party Providers (TPPs) operating within the EU/EEA. Its primary scope covers:
1.  **Account Information Services (AIS):** Accessing and aggregating data from payment accounts (e.g., bank accounts, credit cards).
2.  **Payment Initiation Services (PIS):** Initiating payments on behalf of a user.
3.  **Payment Instrument Issuing/Acquiring.**

This agent interacts exclusively with **Google Calendar**, **Gmail**, and **Twilio**. It does not interact with banking APIs, access payment account data (checking/savings transaction history), or initiate financial transfers. Therefore, it falls outside the regulatory scope of PSD2.

### 3. Specific Violations
**No violations found.**

Because the agent does not perform payment services or access payment account information, it is not subject to PSD2 requirements such as Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) or secure open banking communication standards.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
No remediation is required regarding PSD2.

*Note on General Security (Non-PSD2):* While not a PSD2 violation, the Google OAuth token associated with this agent includes broad scopes (e.g., `drive`, `documents`, `spreadsheets`, `userinfo.profile`) that are not utilized by the agent's actual logic (which only uses Calendar and Gmail). Under general "Least Privilege" security principles, it is recommended to reduce these scopes to `calendar.readonly` and `gmail.send` to minimize general risk.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT** (Not Applicable)
