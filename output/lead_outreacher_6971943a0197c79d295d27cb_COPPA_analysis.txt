ID: lead-outreacher-6971943a0197c79d295d27cb
Log file: None
Regulation: COPPA
============================================================

Based on the review of the [AGENT_DEFINITION] and configuration provided for the agent "Lead Outreacher," here is the compliance assessment regarding the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

### 1. Summary of the Agent's Function
The "Lead Outreacher" functions as an autonomous Sales Development Representative (SDR). Its primary workflow is:
1.  **Trigger:** Detects a new row (a lead) added to a specific Google Sheet.
2.  **Action:** Drafts and sends a sequence of three personalized B2B sales emails via a connected Gmail account.
3.  **Content:** The emails discuss business metrics (e.g., "30% increase on ROAS," "company goals").
4.  **Logic:** It utilizes a "wait" function to space emails over several days and cancels future emails if a response is detected or the sequence concludes.

### 2. Whether COPPA is Applicable and Why
**COPPA is NOT applicable to this agent.**

**Reasoning:**
*   **Target Audience:** COPPA applies to websites and online services directed to children under 13, or those that have actual knowledge they are collecting personal information from children. This agent is explicitly designed for B2B (Business-to-Business) sales. The system instructions reference "closing deals," "ROAS" (Return on Ad Spend), and "company size."
*   **Nature of Content:** The generated content constitutes professional business correspondence. There are no visual, audio, or interactive elements designed to attract children (e.g., cartoons, games, simple language).
*   **Data Source:** The agent ingests data provided by the enterprise user via a Google Sheet, presumptively containing business contact information for professional leads.

### 3. Whether Specific Violations of COPPA are Found
**No violations found.**

As the regulation is not applicable to the agent's intended use case and operational logic, there are no infringements regarding parental consent, data minimization, or privacy notices for minors.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
**None required.**

*   *Note:* While no remediation is required for the agent code, standard enterprise data hygiene should ensure the input source (the Google Sheet) contains legitimately sourced business leads. However, this is a data governance issue, not a COPPA violation within the agent itself.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**
