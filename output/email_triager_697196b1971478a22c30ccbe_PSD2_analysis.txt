Agent: Email Triager
ID: email-triager-697196b1971478a22c30ccbe
Log file: None
Regulation: PSD2
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition (`[AGENT_DEFINITION]`), here is the assessment regarding PSD2 compliance. Note that while you mentioned a `[SAMPLE_LOG]`, only the agent definition JSON was provided; however, the definition is sufficient to determine the functionality and regulatory scope.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **Email Triager** is an automated workflow designed to manage a Gmail inbox. Its specific functions are:
*   **Trigger:** Listens for incoming Gmail messages (`onGmailMessageReceived`).
*   **Logic:** Analyzes email content to classify it into categories (High Priority, Customer Question, Newsletter, FAQ, Spam).
*   **Actions:**
    *   Applies specific Gmail labels (e.g., "Important," "Newsletter," "Spam").
    *   Queries a Knowledge Base for answers to customer FAQs.
    *   Automatically sends email replies via Gmail for identified FAQs.
*   **Scope:** The agent operates exclusively within the context of email management (Gmail API) and document retrieval (Knowledge Base).

### 2. PSD2 Applicability
**Verdict: Not Applicable.**

**Reasoning:**
The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) regulates payment services and payment service providers within the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA). Its scope covers:
*   **PISPs (Payment Initiation Service Providers):** Initiating payments on behalf of a user.
*   **AISPs (Account Information Service Providers):** Aggregating and viewing bank account information.
*   **SCA (Strong Customer Authentication):** Security protocols for electronic payments.

This agent **does not fall under the scope of PSD2** because:
1.  **No Financial Interaction:** The agent connects strictly to `googleAuth` scopes (Gmail, Calendar, Drive). It does not connect to banking APIs or financial institutions (Open Banking APIs).
2.  **No Payment Processing:** The agent does not initiate, process, or facilitate money transfers or payments.
3.  **No Account Aggregation:** The agent processes unstructured text data (emails) for categorization, not for aggregating structured financial account data.

### 3. Specific Violations of PSD2
**None.**

Since the regulation does not apply to the functional scope of this agent (email automation and inbox triage), there are no violations of PSD2 articles (such as Article 97 regarding SCA or Article 66/67 regarding access to payment accounts).

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
**No remediation is required regarding PSD2.**

*Note: While not related to PSD2, standard data privacy controls (GDPR) should be applied given the agent reads the body of incoming emails, which may contain PII.*

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

(The agent is compliant because the regulation acts as "Not Applicable" to this specific technology stack and use case.)
