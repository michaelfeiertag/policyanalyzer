Agent: Lindy Agent ListerAbout 8 hours ago+2
ID: lindy-agent-lister-693c78bb39099082df392692
Log file: None
Regulation: FERPA
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition and configuration, here is the security and compliance assessment regarding FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act).

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **Lindy Agent Lister** is an administrative automation tool designed to maintain an inventory of AI agents within the user's workspace.
*   **Trigger:** It runs on a recurring schedule (hourly).
*   **Operation:** It queries the Lindy API to retrieve a list of all existing agents/tasks in the workspace.
*   **Output:** It iterates through this list and performs an "upsert" (update or insert) operation into a specific Google Sheet (`1auUbfTVe3XnLfvMoFdLsC8nqO5QW0srkyIvyBGyZu2Q`).
*   **Data Points:** It explicitly records only three fields: `AgentID`, `Agent Name`, and `Last Task Date`.

### 2. FERPA Applicability
**FERPA is NOT Applicable to this agent.**

**Reasoning:**
FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) applies specifically to **"Education Records"** and **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** derived from those records (e.g., grades, transcripts, student schedules, disciplinary records) maintained by an educational institution.

The data processed by this agent is **Operational IT Metadata**.
*   **AgentID:** A system-generated string identifying a software configuration.
*   **Agent Name:** The label given to a software bot.
*   **Last Task Date:** A system timestamp indicating when the software was last active.

Unless the organization is using student names as "Agent Names" (which would be an improper naming convention but still incidental), this data does not constitute an "Education Record." It is an inventory of software assets, not students.

### 3. Specific Violations
**No FERPA violations found.**

*   The agent does not request access to student databases.
*   The agent does not process student PII.
*   The output destination (Google Sheets) is receiving system configuration data, not protected educational data.
*   The authentication used (`m@mftestco.com`) appears to be a corporate/commercial account rather than an educational institution account (`.edu`), further distancing the likelihood of FERPA relevance.

### 4. Remediation Recommendations
No remediation is required for FERPA compliance. However, as general security best practices:

1.  **Access Control:** Verify that the destination Google Sheet (`Lindy Agents`) is shared only with authorized IT/Admin personnel, as it reveals the internal structure of your AI workspace.
2.  **Naming Conventions:** Enforce a policy that "Agent Names" must not contain PII of any kind (student or employee), ensuring this metadata remains purely operational.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

*The agent operates outside the scope of FERPA as it processes IT system metadata rather than student educational records.*
