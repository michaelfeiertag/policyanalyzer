Agent: Personal Computer Assistant
ID: personal-computer-assistant-697194cf64cff41a8f386a07
Log file: None
Regulation: FTC-Act
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition (and noting that the Sample Log was referenced but not included in the prompt), here is the assessment regarding the FTC Act.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **Personal Computer Assistant** is a general-purpose automation agent designed to execute tasks within a sandboxed computer environment ("Lindy Computer"). It utilizes a browser tool to interact with third-party websites.
*   **Intended Capabilities:** Its configuration explicitly invites users to conduct financial and sensitive transactions, including "Buy groceries on Instacart," "Order food on Doordash," "Check my credit card statement," and "Find a doctor."
*   **Operational Mode:** It operates with an `ActionNode` ("Start Computer Session") followed by an `AgentStateNode` (mislabeled "Send Instagram DM" but governed by the guideline "do whatever they want").
*   **Autonomy:** The agent is configured to operate fully autonomously without human intervention during execution.

### 2. FTC Act Applicability
**Yes, the FTC Act is applicable.**
*   **Commerce:** The agent is explicitly engaged in "commerce" as defined by the Act. Conversation starters strictly pertain to purchasing goods (Instacart, Doordash) and managing financial instruments (Credit Card statements).
*   **Consumer Data:** The agent invites the processing of sensitive consumer data (financial and health/doctor search).
*   **Liability:** Under Section 5 of the FTC Act, companies are liable for "unfair or deceptive acts or practices." This applies to AI agents that facilitate purchases or handle sensitive data. If the agent executes a transaction the user did not intend due to lack of safeguards, or exposes data despite implied security, it falls under FTC jurisdiction.

### 3. Specific Violations of FTC Act
Based on the configuration provided, the agent introduces **definitive, significant compliance risks** that would be categorized as "Unfair Practices" under Section 5.

**Violation A: Lack of Transactional Safeguards (Unfairness)**
*   **The Issue:** The agent invites financial transactions (ordering food/groceries) but the `AgentStateNode` (Node ID: `...86a10`) is explicitly configured with **`requireConfirmation: "Never"`**.
*   **The Violation:** The FTC defines a practice as "Unfair" if it causes substantial injury that is not reasonably avoidable by consumers. By disabling confirmation on an agent designed to spend money, the organization removes the consumer's ability to verify the price, quantity, or items before the charge is executed. If the LLM hallucinates (e.g., ordering 50 units instead of 5, or selecting the wrong item), the consumer is financially injured without a mechanism to prevent it.
*   **Risk:** Unauthorized or erroneous billing.

**Violation B: Deceptive Security regarding Financial Data**
*   **The Issue:** The agent invites users to "Check my credit card statement" and "Find a doctor" (PHI/PII), but the `actionConfiguration` shows `auth: null` and simply spins up a generic remote browser session (`LindyComputer`).
*   **The Violation:** Providing a pre-set prompt to access banking/medical portals implies the agent has a secure, compliant method to handle credentials or sessions for those specific services. However, the agent is using a generic, unauthenticated browser tool. This encourages users to input high-value credentials (banking/health) into a potentially unmonitored or non-compliant sandbox environment. If the security does not match the sensitivity of the invited tasks (Banking/Health), this is a "Deceptive" practice regarding data security.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
To mitigate these risks and move towards compliance:

1.  **Enforce Human-in-the-Loop for Payments:** Change `requireConfirmation` from `"Never"` to `"Always"` for the `AgentStateNode`. Any action that results in a financial transaction (Doordash/Instacart) must present the cart and total to the user for approval before execution.
2.  **Restrict High-Risk Conversation Starters:** Remove "Check my credit card statement" and "Find a doctor in network" from `conversationStarters` unless the `LindyComputer` environment is certified for PCI-DSS (payments) and HIPAA (health) compliance. Promoting these uses without verified infrastructure is a liability.
3.  **Correct Node Labeling:** The `AgentStateNode` display name is "Send Instagram DM," yet the instructions are generic ("help the user do whatever"). This mismatch creates a risk of the agent behaving unpredictably or performing actions the user does not anticipate based on the internal labeling. Align the Display Name with the Guidelines.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**NON-COMPLIANT**

**Reasoning:** While the agent functions technically, the configuration `requireConfirmation: "Never"` on an agent explicitly marketed for financial transactions (groceries/food delivery) constitutes a lack of reasonable safeguards against unauthorized charges. This is a primary trigger for FTC "Unfairness" enforcement.
