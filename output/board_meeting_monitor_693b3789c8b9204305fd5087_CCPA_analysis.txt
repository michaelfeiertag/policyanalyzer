Agent: Board meeting monitorAbout 10 hours ago
ID: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
Log file: None
Regulation: CCPA
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition, here is the assessment regarding CCPA compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent ("Board meeting monitor") is an automated workflow that runs on a recurring schedule twice daily (9:00 AM and 6:00 PM).
*   **Input:** It accesses a Google Calendar belonging to `m@mftestco.com` to search for events matching the query "Board meeting" scheduled for the following day.
*   **Logic:** It differentiates between the morning and afternoon runs.
*   **Output:**
    *   **Morning:** Sends an email via Gmail to `m@testco.com` (likely containing the event details).
    *   **Afternoon:** Sends an SMS via Twilio to `+14155312776` (likely containing the event details).

### 2. CCPA Applicability
**Status: Applicable**

*   **Personal Information (PI) Processing:** The agent accesses Google Calendar events. Calendar invites inherently contain PI as defined by CCPA (names, email addresses of attendees/employees/board members, and potentially physical locations).
*   **Business Context:** The agent is deployed within an enterprise ("mftestco.com"), which typically meets the threshold for CCPA compliance (gross revenue or data processing volume).
*   **Employee/B2B Data:** Following the expiration of CPRA exemptions, data regarding employees and business contacts (e.g., board members) is fully protected under CCPA.

### 3. Specific Violations of CCPA
**Finding: Definitive Violations Found**

The agent demonstrates a significant violation of **Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.100(c)**, which mandates that a business's collection and use of personal information shall be "reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purposes for which the personal information was collected or processed."

*   **Violation: Failure to Minimize Data Access (Excessive Permissions)**
    The agent's Google Authentication configuration grants **Full Access** scopes that are wholly unnecessary for the agent's function. The agent only reads a calendar and sends an email, yet it retains active tokens for:
    *   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` (Full read/write access to all files in Google Drive)
    *   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` (Full access to Sheets)
    *   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents` (Full access to Docs)
    *   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly` (Full read access to all emails)

    By maintaining these permissions, the agent exposes vast amounts of Consumer PI (contained in Drive, Sheets, and User Mailboxes) to potential breach or misuse without a legitimate business purpose for that specific access. This violates the principle of Data Minimization.

*   **Risk Finding: Reasonable Security Procedures (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.150)**
    The agent transmits Board Meeting details via SMS (Twilio) to `+14155312776`. SMS is a non-encrypted transmission protocol. Transmitting sensitive meeting data (which links specific individuals to specific sensitive locations/times) via cleartext SMS may fail the "reasonable security procedures" test required to protect PI from unauthorized access.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
To bring this agent into compliance, the following actions are required:

1.  **Scope Minimization (Critical):** Revoke the current Google Auth credentials and issue new credentials strictly limited to the operational needs:
    *   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly`
    *   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send`
    *   **Remove** all Drive, Docs, Spreadsheets, and Gmail Read/Modify scopes immediately.
2.  **Hardcoded PII Removal:** The agent definition contains hardcoded phone numbers (`+14155312776`, `+15103453222`) and email addresses (`m@testco.com`) in the configuration JSON. These should be moved to secure environment variables or a secrets manager to prevent exposure of employee contact information in the codebase.
3.  **Transmission Review:** Review whether Board Meeting details contain sensitive PI. If so, disable the SMS notification channel and rely solely on TLS-encrypted Email, or direct the SMS to send a generic "Check your secure calendar" notification rather than the event details themselves.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Rating: Non-Compliant**

The agent is **Non-Compliant** due to the violation of Data Minimization principles (§ 1798.100(c)). The agent holds the keys to the entire unauthorized Google Drive and Email history of the user while performing a simple calendar check, creating an unacceptable and disproportionate compliance risk.
