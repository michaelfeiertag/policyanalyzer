Agent: SEO Blog Writer
ID: seo-blog-writer-6971952e930a41d9e2623ea7
Log file: None
Regulation: FTC-Act
============================================================

Based on the review of the provided JSON Agent Definition for the "SEO Blog Writer," here is the compliance assessment regarding the FTC Act.

**Note on Input:** You referenced a `[SAMPLE_LOG]`, but only the `[AGENT_DEFINITION]` JSON was provided. This assessment is based strictly on the logic and instructions contained within the agent's code and configuration.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **SEO Blog Writer** is an automated content marketing agent designed to generate long-form (1500+ words) blog posts. Its workflow consists of:
1.  **Ingesting** user criteria (topic, audience, brand voice, URL).
2.  **Executing** web searches via Perplexity (Action Nodes) to analyze the brand's website and research the topic/keywords.
3.  **Generating** an article based on that research, tailored to specific SEO parameters (headers, keyword density).
4.  **Outputting** the article along with metadata (meta descriptions, word count) to the user.

### 2. Applicability of FTC Act
**Yes, the FTC Act is applicable.**
The FTC Act (specifically Section 5) prohibits "unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce." This agent produces **commercial advertising and marketing material** (content marketing). The FTC has explicitly ruled that businesses are liable for claims made by AI tools they employ.

The specific areas of applicability are:
*   **Substantiation of Claims:** If the agent generates content making objective claims about a product (health benefits, financial results, performance), those claims must be true and substantiated.
*   **Endorsements/Testimonials:** If the agent mimics a consumer opinion.
*   **Copyright/Plagiarism:** While primarily IP law, systemic scraping and republishing without transformation can be considered an unfair business practice.

### 3. Specific Violations of FTC Act
**No definitive violations found in the Agent Definition.**

Based on the configuration provided, the agent is **not** inherently non-compliant. The following factors support this conclusion:
*   **Research-Based Logic:** The agent is configured with `ActionNode` steps using **Perplexity** to perform "Deep Research" before writing. It is explicitly instructed to include "statistics, examples, and expert insights **from research**." It is not instructed to hallucinate or fabricate data, which is the primary FTC risk with Generative AI.
*   **No Deceptive Instruction:** The prompt instructs the agent to write as an "expert SEO content writer" representing the brand. It does not instruct the agent to:
    *   Pose as a fake independent consumer (Astroturfing).
    *   Generate fake reviews.
    *   Hide the commercial nature of the content (it creates "blog posts" for the brand, which are understood to be commercial).
*   **No "Black Hat" SEO:** The instructions focus on "genuine value," "readability," and "comprehensive" content, rather than deceptive cloaking or keyword stuffing that might be construed as "unfair competition" or deceptive trade practices.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation & Risk Control
While the *tool* is compliant, the *output* creates operational risk. To ensure the generated content does not violate the FTC Act upon publication, the following controls are required:

*   **Mandatory Human Review (Fact-Checking):** The agent is instructed to use "expert insights" and "statistics." AI (even with search access) can hallucinate citations or misinterpret data.
    *   *Recommendation:* Implement a policy that all AI-generated claims regarding product efficacy, pricing, or statistics must be verified by a human against the source provided by Perplexity before publication.
*   **Disclosure of AI Use (Context Dependent):**
    *   *Recommendation:* If this content is published under a specific author's byline (e.g., "Written by John Doe"), it may be deceptive if John Doe did not write it. Ensure the content is published under a corporate byline (e.g., "Team [Brand Name]") or discloses AI assistance if required by specific industry regulations (though the FTC Act itself does not currently mandate a blanket "Written by AI" label for standard blog copy unless the lack of disclosure is misleading).
*   **Tone Policing:**
    *   *Recommendation:* Ensure the `brand voice` input provided by the user does not instruct the AI to make absolute claims (e.g., "We cure cancer") which the AI will obediently generate, creating immediate liability.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

The agent definition contains no instructions that force the commission of illegal acts, deceptive practices, or unfair competition. It functions as a productivity tool for drafting marketing copy based on web research. Liability rests solely on the human operator reviewing and publishing the content.
