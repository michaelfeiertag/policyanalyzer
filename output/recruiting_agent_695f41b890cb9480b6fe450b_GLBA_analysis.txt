ID: recruiting-agent-695f41b890cb9480b6fe450b
Log file: None
Regulation: GLBA
============================================================

Based on the Agent Definition and configuration provided, here is the assessment regarding GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **Recruiting Agent** is an automated Sales Development Representative (SDR) and recruiting assistant. Its primary workflow is:
1.  **Data Collection:** Uses the **People Data Labs (PDL)** API to search for potential candidates or leads based on criteria like job title, location, industry, and skills.
2.  **Data Processing:** Extracts personally identifiable information (PII) such as full names, personal emails, mobile phones, LinkedIn URLs, and employment history.
3.  **Storage:** Creates and exports this data into **Google Sheets**.
4.  **Outreach:** Has the capability to loop through these leads and send cold outreach emails via **Gmail**.

### 2. GLBA Applicability
**Verdict: NOT APPLICABLE**

GLBA is likely **not applicable** to this specific agent for the following reasons:

*   **Definition of Consumer:** GLBA applies to Financial Institutions regarding the protection of data belonging to their *consumers* (individuals obtaining financial products or services). This agent is designed for **Recruiting** and **B2B Lead Generation**. The individuals being processed are prospective employees or business leads, not consumers establishing a financial relationship with your institution via this agent.
*   **Definition of Nonpublic Personal Information (NPI):** GLBA regulates "Nonpublic Personal Information." NPI is defined as information provided by a consumer to a financial institution, resulting from a transaction, or obtained in connection with providing a financial product.
    *   This agent sources data from **People Data Labs**, a third-party data aggregator.
    *   The data (Job Titles, LinkedIn URLs, Emails) is sourced from public records or commercial data aggregation, not from your internal banking/financial customer records.
    *   Under GLBA, "Publicly Available Information" is generally exempt from the definition of NPI.

### 3. Specific Violations
**None found.**

Since the data being processed does not meet the statutory definition of Nonpublic Personal Information (NPI) under GLBA, and the context is human resources/recruitment rather than financial service provision, there are no definitive GLBA violations.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
While GLBA does not apply, the agent introduces other regulatory risks you should be aware of. No remediation is required for GLBA specifically, but standard security hygiene suggests:

*   **Check CASL/CAN-SPAM/GDPR Status:** The agent sends automated emails (`Gmail.send` action) to personal email addresses retrieved from a data broker (`recommended_personal_email` field from PDL). While not a GLBA issue, this presents privacy and anti-spam compliance risks depending on the jurisdiction of the leads.
*   **Google Workspace Permissions:** Ensure the `GoogleSheets.create` action does not default to creating "Public to the Web" spreadsheets, as this would expose the recruited candidates' PII.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT** (GLBA Not Applicable)
