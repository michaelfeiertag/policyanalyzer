Agent: AI CMO | Research Agent
ID: ai-cmo-research-agent-697194e773107647553ffb5a
Log file: None
Regulation: ADA
============================================================

Based on the review of the [AGENT_DEFINITION] for the "AI CMO | Research Agent," here is the compliance assessment regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent acts as an automated Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) researcher. It accepts a company URL from the user, scrapes the website to identify the company's identity, and utilizes the Perplexity search engine to conduct deep research into competitors, industry keywords, and customer profiles. The final output consists of multiple generated Google Documents containing research reports, brand guidelines, and competitor analysis.

### 2. ADA Applicability
**Applicable.**
The ADA applies to this agent under **Title I (Employment)**. As a tool deployed within an enterprise ("Michael Feiertags Workspace"), this agent constitutes software provided by an employer to employees. The employer is legally required to provide accessible tools to employees with disabilities (e.g., blind users employing screen readers, users with motor impairments).

If the output documents (Google Docs) are shared externally with clients or the public, **Title III (Public Accommodation)** also applies, requiring effective communication and accessible digital content (WCAG 2.1 AA standards).

### 3. Specific Violations
I have identified **2 definitive violations** inherent in the agent's logic and configuration that pose a compliance risk.

**Violation 1: Generation of Non-Semantic (Unstructured) Documents (WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships)**
*   **The Issue:** The agent generates long-form Google Docs (e.g., "Deep Competitor Research" in Node `697194e773107647553ffb73` and `697194e773107647553ffb78`). The prompt requests "Response Format: Markdown."
*   **The Risk:** While the agent requests visual headers (Markdown `###`), raw text injection into Google Docs often results in text that *looks* like a header (bold/large) but lacks the programmatic `Heading 1` / `Heading 2` tags.
*   **Impact:** A blind employee using a screen reader cannot navigate these long reports by section. They would have to listen to the entire document linearly to find specific data points (e.g., "Revenue"), which is considered a failure to provide "effective communication" under the ADA.

**Violation 2: Missing Alternative Text for Visual Assets (WCAG 1.1.1 Non-text Content)**
*   **The Issue:** In the "Brand Guidelines" step (Node `697194e773107647553ffb8a`), the agent is instructed to find and output the "logo_url". It creates a document containing this asset.
*   **The Risk:** The prompt explicitly asks for the URL and hex codes but **does not** ask the AI to generate a textual description of the logo (Alt Text).
*   **Impact:** A visually impaired user will encounter a link or an image in the document but will have no way of knowing what the logo looks like (e.g., "Blue abstract mountain icon"). The agent retrieves visual data but fails to process it for non-visual consumption.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation

**For Violation 1 (Structure):**
*   **Modify System Prompts:** Update the system prompt in Nodes `b73`, `b85`, and `b88` to explicitly instruct the LLM to "Use strict Markdown formatting for headers."
*   **Integration Check:** Verify that the "Lindy > Google Docs > Create" tool specifically parses Markdown headers (`#`, `##`) into Google Docs `Heading Style` objects. If the tool only pastes plain text, the integration code must be updated to support semantic mapping.

**For Violation 2 (Alt Text):**
*   **Add an Analysis Step:** Insert a new step after locating the Logo URL. Use a Vision-capable model (like GPT-4o) with the prompt: *"Analyze this logo image and provide a concise text description for accessibility Alt Text."*
*   **Update Output:** Configure the "Brand Guidelines" document generation to include this description text next to or immediately following the logo URL.

### 5. Compliance Rating
**Rating: Partially Compliant**

The agent is functional but produces artifacts (documents) that likely fail WCAG 2.1 AA standards. While the chat interface itself relies on the platform's accessibility, the *work product* generated by this specific agent configuration introduces liability by creating inaccessible business documents.
