Agent: Board meeting monitorAbout 10 hours ago
ID: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
Log file: None
Regulation: NIST-AI-RMF
============================================================

Based on the provided `[AGENT_DEFINITION]`, here is the risk assessment against the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF).

**Note:** You mentioned a `[SAMPLE_LOG]`, but only the agent definition was provided. However, the architectural and configuration violations in the definition are sufficient to render a definitive assessment without needing the execution logs.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **"Board meeting monitor"** is an automated agent designed to run twice daily (9:00 AM and 6:00 PM). Its workflow is:
1.  **Trigger:** Activates on a recurring schedule.
2.  **Input Processing:** Uses an LLM to search a connected Google Calendar for "board meetings the next day that start before 9am PT."
3.  **Logic:** Determines if the current execution time is "morning" or "afternoon."
4.  **Action:**
    *   If Morning: Sends an email via Gmail to `m@testco.com`.
    *   If Afternoon: Sends an SMS via Twilio to a specific phone number.

### 2. NIST AI RMF Applicability
**Status: Applicable**

The NIST AI RMF applies to this agent because:
1.  **Generative AI Usage:** The agent utilizes an LLM (Large Language Model) to interpret the command "Look for board meetings..." and filter calendar events. This introduces non-deterministic behavior (probabilistic risk) characteristic of AI systems.
2.  **Automated Decision Making:** The agent makes autonomous decisions based on natural language logic ("it's the morning") to route workflows.
3.  **Real-world Impact:** The agent triggers external communications (SMS/Email) based on AI inferences, creating risks related to reliability and privacy.

### 3. Specific Violations of NIST AI RMF
The following are definitive, significant violations found in the configuration that present practical security and compliance risks.

**A. Critical Violation: Failure of Least Privilege (Data Minimization)**
*   **NIST Reference:** *Map 1.5 (Data privacy and security risks)* and *Manage 1.3 (Risk treatment).*
*   **Observation:** The agent performs two simple tasks: reading a Calendar and sending an Email. However, the OAuth configuration (`ActionNode` ID `693b3791...`) grants the following excessive scopes:
    *   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` (Full Read/Write access to all Google Drive files)
    *   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` (Full control of Spreadsheets)
    *   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify` (Ability to delete/modify existing emails)
    *   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`
*   **Risk:** If this agent or the vendor (Lindy) is compromised, the attacker has full administrative control over the user's entire Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Drive), far beyond the scope of "checking a calendar." This is a catastrophic security posture.

**B. Violation: Improper Management of PII (Privacy)**
*   **NIST Reference:** *Govern 4.1 (Privacy risk management)* and *Map 3.3 (Data management).*
*   **Observation:** Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is hardcoded directly into the agent's configuration JSON (`actionConfiguration`):
    *   Target Phone Number: `+14155312776`
    *   Target Email: `m@testco.com`
*   **Risk:** This configuration lacks abstraction. If this agent definition is exported, backed up, or shared (e.g., in a template library), the private contact details of the board members/executives are exposed in plain text.

**C. Violation: Lack of Human Oversight / Safe Failure Mode**
*   **NIST Reference:** *Measure 2.2 (Reliability)* and *Manage 2.4 (Response to failures).*
*   **Observation:** The Email action has `"saveAsDraft": false` and the SMS action executes immediately.
*   **Risk:** The Calendar search relies on an LLM prompt ("Look for board meetings"). If the LLM hallucinates (e.g., interpreting "Keyboard cleaning" as "Board meeting"), the system automatically transmits false information to stakeholders without a verification step ("Human-in-the-loop").

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
1.  **Immediate Scope Reduction:** Revoke the current Google Auth credentials. Re-authenticate utilizing *only* the scopes required for function: `calendar.readonly` and `gmail.send`. Remove all Drive, Docs, and Sheet permissions.
2.  **Tokenize PII:** Replace hardcoded phone numbers and email addresses with Environment Variables or Context Variables (e.g., `{{recipient_email}}`) to prevent PII leakage in the configuration file.
3.  **Implement Approval Flow:** Change the Gmail action to `saveAsDraft: true` or implement a "User Confirmation" step before the SMS is sent to ensure the AI has correctly identified a meeting before alerting executives.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Rating: Non-Compliant**

**Justification:** While the agent functions mechanically, the **excessive permissions violation** (Violation A) represents an unacceptable security risk for an enterprise environment. The agent requests full read/write access to the user's entire digital life (Drive/Docs/Sheets) to perform a simple read-only calendar check. It cannot be deployed in its current state.
