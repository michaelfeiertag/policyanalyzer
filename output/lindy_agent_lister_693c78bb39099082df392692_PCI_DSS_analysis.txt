ID: lindy-agent-lister-693c78bb39099082df392692
Log file: None
Regulation: PCI-DSS
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition and the context of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), here is the assessment.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **Lindy Agent Lister** is an administrative utility agent designed to inventory and monitor other agents within the workspace.
*   **Trigger:** It runs on a recurring hourly schedule (`0 * * * *`).
*   **Process:** It queries the internal Lindy API to retrieve a list of all agents, specifically capturing their `AgentID`, `Agent Name`, and `Last Task Date`.
*   **Output:** It iterates through this list and performs an "upsert" (update or insert) operation into a specific Google Sheet (`1auUbfTVe3XnLfvMoFdLsC8nqO5QW0srkyIvyBGyZu2Q`) to maintain an up-to-date registry of agents.

### 2. PCI-DSS Applicability
**Verdict: Not Applicable**

**Reasoning:**
PCI-DSS applies specifically to entities that store, process, or transmit Cardholder Data (CHD) (e.g., Primary Account Numbers) or Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD).
*   **Data Classification:** This agent handles **System Metadata** (Agent IDs, Names, timestamps).
*   **Scope:** The defined inputs and outputs do not interact with payment gateways, financial transaction logs, or customer billing information.
*   **Transmission:** The data flows from the Lindy internal API to Google Sheets. Neither of these endpoints is configured to handle payment data in this specific workflow.

### 3. Specific Violations
**None Found.**

As the agent does not interact with the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE), it cannot violate PCI-DSS requirements. There is no evidence in the trace or definition that this agent has access to, or is attempting to log, credit card numbers or sensitive authentication data.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
*   **No remediation is required for PCI-DSS compliance.**
*   *General Security Note (Non-PCI):* Ensure the Google Sheet defined in the configuration (`1auUbfTVe3XnLfvMoFdLsC8nqO5QW0srkyIvyBGyZu2Q`) has its access permissions restricted to authorized personnel only, as it exposes the inventory of your enterprise's automation agents.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant** (Scope Not Applicable)
