Log file: None
Regulation: FTC-Act
============================================================

Based on the provided [AGENT_DEFINITION] and the specific requirements of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), here is the assessment.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **Recruiting Agent** is an automated prospecting tool designed to source candidates and sales leads. Its workflow involves:
*   Accepting user criteria (role, location, industry, skills).
*   Querying the **People Data Labs (PDL)** API to retrieve personal identifiable information (PII) including full names, job titles, current/past companies, personal/work emails, and phone numbers.
*   Aggregating this data into a **Google Sheet**.
*   Initiating a "Loop" sequence to draft and send cold outreach emails via **Gmail** to the identified individuals.
*   **Crucial Control:** The Gmail "Send email" action (Node `695f41b990cb9480b6fe451e`) is configured with `requireConfirmation: "Always"`, meaning a human user must approve every specific email before it is sent.

### 2. FTC Act Applicability
**Yes, the FTC Act is applicable.**
*   **Commercial Activity:** The agent is engaged in "commerce" by facilitating recruiting and business-to-business sales outreach.
*   **Section 5 (Unfair or Deceptive Acts):** The FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices. This applies to:
    *   **Data Privacy:** How consumer data (leads) is sourced and used.
    *   **Commercial Outreach:** Ensuring the agent does not facilitate deceptive impersonation (e.g., an AI pretending to be a human without disclosure) or unfair spamming practices.

### 3. Violation Assessment
**Does the agent violate the FTC Act?**
**No.** Based on the current configuration, there are **no definitive, significant violations**.

**Reasoning:**
*   **No Deceptive Impersonation:** The email action contains a default signature field: `"sig": "Sent from [Lindy](https://lindy.ai)"`. This acts as an affirmative disclosure that the communication originated from an AI/automation tool, mitigating claims of deception regarding the sender's identity.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop (Prevention of Unfair Automations):** The specific Gmail action node has the property `requireConfirmation: "Always"`. This means the agent cannot autonomously spam users or send unverified claims. The legal liability for the content of the email shifts to the human operator who must manually confirm the action.
*   **Legitimate Data Sourcing:** The agent uses "People Data Labs," a known commercial data aggregator. Sourcing publicly available business contact information for B2B prospecting is generally a standard commercial practice and does not constitute an "unfair" practice under Section 5, provided the data isn't used for eligibility determinations (Credit/Employment screening) which falls under FCRA, not the general FTC Act Section 5 prohibitions on commerce.
*   **Honesty regarding capabilities:** The agent instructions explicitly state: *"If the user asks for information that requires external research... inform them that you can't perform this task."* This prevents the "hallucination" of data, which could otherwise be considered a deceptive practice.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
While the agent is compliant, the following adjustments reduce residual risk regarding commercial email laws (CAN-SPAM, often enforced by the FTC):

*   **CAN-SPAM Compliance in Prompting:** Update the prompt for the "Send email" action (Node `695f41b990cb9480b6fe451e`) or the Agent State (Node `695f41b990cb9480b6fe451f`) to explicitly instruct the AI to include a **physical mailing address** and an **opt-out/unsubscribe statement** in the email body.
    *   *Current Risk:* The agent drafts the body. If the human confirms the draft without adding an address/opt-out, the email violates CAN-SPAM. The Agent should draft the compliance footer automatically to protect the organization.
*   **FCRA Guardrails:** Although not a direct Section 5 violation for *sourcing*, using enriched data for *screening* (deciding to hire/fire) is regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). You should add a system instruction: *"Do not use this data for background checks or final employment eligibility decisions; use only for initial candidate sourcing."*

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

The agent includes necessary disclosures ("Sent from Lindy"), relies on human confirmation for external communication, and avoids making autonomous, deceptive claims.
