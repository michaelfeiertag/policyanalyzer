Agent: AI CMO | Research Agent
ID: ai-cmo-research-agent-697194e773107647553ffb5a
Log file: None
Regulation: NIS2
============================================================

Here is the assessment of the **AI CMO | Research Agent** based on the provided definition and log files, evaluated against the **NIS2 Directive** (Directive (EU) 2022/2555).

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "AI CMO | Research Agent" is an automated business intelligence tool designed to generate competitive analysis and marketing strategy.
*   **Input:** Accepts a company URL from the user.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Scrapes the target website for text content.
    *   Uses external AI services (Perplexity `sonar-reasoning-pro` and `sonar-deep-research`, and GPT-5 via `LLMCall`) to identify competitors, analyze customer personas, define unique selling propositions (USPs), and conduct market sizing.
    *   Executes logic loops to process multiple competitors in parallel.
*   **Output:** Generates multiple **Google Docs** containing detailed reports (Competitor Analysis, Customer Profiles, Brand Guidelines, etc.) and outputs links to these documents in the chat.

### 2. NIS2 Applicability
**Verdict: APPLICABLE (to the Enterprise using the agent)**

NIS2 does not regulate software agents directly; it regulates **entities** (the enterprise). However, as a security officer at a large enterprise, you are required under **Article 21** of NIS2 to implement "appropriate and proportionate technical, operational and organizational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of network and information systems."

This agent falls under NIS2 scrutiny because:
1.  **Supply Chain Security (Art. 21.2.d):** The agent integrates third-party AI services (Perplexity, Lindy, OpenAI) into your business processes.
2.  **Asset Management & Cyber Hygiene (Art. 21.2.e):** The agent creates, modifies, and stores intellectual property (strategy docs) within your corporate environment (Google Drive).
3.  **Data Security:** The agent processes business intelligence which, while potentially public, is aggregated into strategic artifacts that require protection.

### 3. Definitive NIS2 Violations
I have identified **one critical, definitive violation** embedded in the agent's configuration logic that breaches the "Basic Cyber Hygiene" and "Access Control" requirements of NIS2.

#### **Violation: Insecure Default Access Control (Data Leakage)**
*   **Location in Definition:** Nodes `697194e773107647553ffb78`, `...b7c`, `...b85`, `...b86`, `...b88`, `...b8c`, `...b91`.
*   **Evidence:** In the `actionConfiguration` for creating Google Docs, the `sharingPreference` is explicitly hardcoded to:
    ```json
    "value": "Anyone with the link can edit"
    ```
*   **The Risk:** The agent automatically creates documents containing proprietary market strategy, competitor analysis, and internal business logic. It then sets the permissions so that **anyone on the internet with the link can read and edit these documents**.
*   **NIS2 Breach:** This violates **Article 21(2)(e)** regarding "basic cyber hygiene practices." Creating internal strategic assets with public-write permissions by default creates an immediate vector for data leakage and data integrity tampering. For a large enterprise, this is a reportable significant incident if sensitive data is exposed.

#### **Secondary Violation: Lack of Supply Chain Data Controls**
*   **Location:** Action Nodes using Perplexity (`...b61`, `...b63`, etc.) and LLM Calls (`...b7a`, etc.).
*   **Evidence:** The agent sends the target company's data and scraped website text to external third-party models (`sonar-deep-research`, `gpt5`).
*   **NIS2 Breach:** While utilizing AI is not illegal, NIS2 requires **Supply Chain Security (Art. 21.2.d)**. If this agent is used on *confidential* internal projects (e.g., "Analyze this unreleased product page"), the agent transmits this data to external providers without data classification checks or user consent.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
To bring this agent into compliance, the following changes are mandatory:

1.  **Hard Fix for Permissions (Critical):**
    *   Modify all "Create Google Doc" nodes. Change the `sharingPreference` value from `"Anyone with the link can edit"` to **`"Private (only me)"`** or **`"Anyone in my organization can view"`**.
    *   *Implementation:* Locate the `sharingPreference` input in the JSON configuration for every Google Docs node and update the hardcoded value.

2.  **Authentication Review:**
    *   The agent uses a Google Auth connection associated with `m@mftestco.com`. Ensure this is a placeholder or service account. If this agent is deployed to employees, it must be configured to use the **invoking user's credentials** (OAuth passthrough), not a hardcoded single account, to ensure audit trails (required by NIS2 Art. 21.2.f).

3.  **Data Classification Layer:**
    *   Add a logic step before external AI calls (Perplexity/GPT) that classifies the input data. If the user inputs a URL that is internal-only or flagged as confidential, the agent must abort or use a local/private model, rather than sending data to public AI APIs.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating

**Rating: NON-COMPLIANT**

**Reasoning:** The agent is currently configured to exfiltrate internal strategic data by creating publicly editable documents by default. In a large enterprise subject to NIS2, deploying this agent constitutes a failure to implement basic cyber hygiene and access controls, introducing unacceptable risk to the organization's information assets.
