Agent: Customer Support Email Responder
ID: customer-support-email-responder-69719727f262d5cfac0c3eba
Log file: None
Regulation: ECPA
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition and the context of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), here is the compliance assessment.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, titled "Customer Support Email Responder," is an automated workflow designed to manage a Gmail inbox. Its specific logic flow is:
1.  **Trigger:** Monitors a specific Gmail account (`m@mftestco.com`) for incoming messages (`onGmailMessageReceived`).
2.  **Process:** Queries a connected Knowledge Base (`searchKnowledgeBase`) using the content of the email to find relevant answers.
3.  **Logic:** Evaluates if a satisfactory answer was found.
4.  **Action:** If an answer is found, it uses the `Gmail: Send reply` tool to create a response. The configuration is set to `saveAsDraft: true`, meaning a human review is required before sending.

### 2. ECPA Applicability
**Yes, ECPA is applicable.**
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA), specifically Title II (Stored Communications Act), applies to this agent because the agent accesses, reads, and processes stored electronic communications (emails) held by an electronic communication service (Google/Gmail).

### 3. Violation Assessment
**Does the agent violate ECPA? No.**

There are **no definitive ECPA violations** found in this agent definition.

*   **Authorization (The "Consent" Exception):** ECPA prohibits *unauthorized* access to stored communications. This agent operates via OAuth 2.0 authentication (`authConfig` provider: `googleAuth`). The user (`m@mftestco.com`) explicitly granted the agent permission to access the inbox. Under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2511(2)(c) and 2701(c), access is lawful when authorized by a user who has the lawful right to access the communications.
*   **Ordinary Course of Business:** The agent functions as a customer support tool. Automated processing of emails for the purpose of providing customer service falls under the "ordinary course of business" exception, provided the email account is a corporate business account (which `mftestco.com` implies).

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
While the agent does not violate ECPA, it introduces significant **Security and Data Privacy Risk** due to **Over-Permissioning (Violation of Least Privilege)**.

The agent requests and has been granted the following scopes which are **completely unused** by its logic (State Graph):
*   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` (Full access to Google Drive files)
*   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents` (Google Docs)
*   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` (Google Sheets)
*   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` (Full Calendar access)

**Recommendation:**
1.  **Scope Reduction:** Immediately strip the unused scopes from the agent's authentication configuration. The agent only requires `gmail.readonly`, `gmail.compose`, and `gmail.send`. Retaining full Drive and Docs access creates a massive blast radius if this agent is compromised, potentially exposing internal trade secrets or PII irrelevant to email support.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

*The agent is Compliant with ECPA because access is authorized. However, from a general Information Security posture, the agent is **High Risk** due to excessive and unnecessary permission scopes.*
