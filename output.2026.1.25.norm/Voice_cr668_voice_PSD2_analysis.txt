Agent: cr668_voice
ID: cr668_voice
Log file: None
Regulation: PSD2
============================================================

Here is the assessment regarding the attached agent definition and its relation to PSD2.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, named "Voice" (schema `cr668_voice`), is a telephony-based customer service bot designed for a retail environment. Its primary functions include:
*   **Informational Queries:** Providing store hours (Lesson 1) and store locations (Lesson 2).
*   **Product Selection:** allowing users to select computer hardware (Desktops, Laptops, Gaming PCs) and accepting shipping costs based on state location (Lesson 3).
*   **Cart Management:** The agent simulates adding items to a cart (`Topic.Item`) but explicitly directs the user to a different interface to finalize the transaction ("To complete your order, please go to your cart").
*   **Authentication:** Contains a sign-in flow (`OAuthInput`) triggered by system requirements.

### 2. PSD2 Applicability
**PSD2 is Not Applicable.**

The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) regulates Payment Initiation Services (PIS) and Account Information Services (AIS).
*   **No Payment Initiation:** The agent assists in product selection and populates a "cart" variable, but it does not execute a monetary transaction, transfer funds, or process credit card credentials within the conversation flow. It explicitly directs the user elsewhere to complete the order.
*   **No Account Information Access:** The agent does not access, aggregate, or display payment account information (e.g., bank balances, transaction history) from financial institutions.
*   **Authentication Context:** While the agent uses OAuth for sign-in, it is used for general user identification within the bot context, not for authorizing a payment transaction or accessing banking APIs under the scope of PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements.

### 3. Specific Violations
**No violations found.**

*   **SCA (Strong Customer Authentication):** Because the agent stops the workflow prior to the payment stage (directing the user to "go to your cart"), the agent itself is not responsible for performing the SCA challenge required for electronic payments.
*   **Dynamic Linking:** As no transaction amount or payee is finalized and authorized within the bot's logic, dynamic linking requirements are not triggered.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
No remediation is required regarding PSD2, as the agent does not perform regulated payment services.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**

*The agent operates outside the scope of PSD2 regulations based on the provided definition.*
