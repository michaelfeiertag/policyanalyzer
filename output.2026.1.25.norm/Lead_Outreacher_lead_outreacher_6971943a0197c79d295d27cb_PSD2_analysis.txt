ID: lead-outreacher-6971943a0197c79d295d27cb
Log file: None
Regulation: PSD2
============================================================

Based on the review of the provided [AGENT_DEFINITION] and the instructions to assume no violations if no evidence is found (in the absence of the [SAMPLE_LOG]), here is the PSD2 compliance assessment.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, "Lead Outreacher," functions as an automated Sales Development Representative (SDR). Its primary workflow involves:
*   **Trigger:** Monitoring a specific Google Sheet for new rows (leads).
*   **Action:** Sending a sequence of three personalized outreach emails via Gmail to the lead.
*   **Logic:** Utilizing timers to create delays (drip campaign) between emails.
*   **Goal:** To engage potential customers and solicit a response for sales purposes.

### 2. PSD2 Applicability
**PSD2 is NOT Applicable.**

The Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) regulates payment services and payment service providers within the European Union. Its scope includes Account Information Service Providers (AISPs) and Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs).

This agent is outside the scope of PSD2 for the following reasons:
*   **No Payment Initiation:** The agent does not initiate, process, or manage electronic payment transactions.
*   **No Account Access:** The agent does not access payment accounts (bank accounts, credit card portals) or aggregate financial data. It only accesses a Google Sheet containing contact information (leads).
*   **Not a Regulated Entity:** The agent performs marketing and communication tasks, which are not classified as "payment services" under Annex I of PSD2.

### 3. Specific Violations of PSD2
**None.**

As the agent operates entirely outside the regulatory perimeter of PSD2, it cannot violate the directive. The tools used (Gmail, Google Sheets, Timer) are not being used to circumvent authentication for payments or access sensitive financial data.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **No remediation required regarding PSD2.**
*   *Note:* While outside the scope of this specific PSD2 assessment, ensure the agent complies with data privacy regulations (GDPR) and anti-spam laws (CAN-SPAM/ePrivacy Directive) given its function involves automated emailing of personal data.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**

*(Rationale: The agent does not interact with financial systems or payment data, posing zero risk regarding PSD2 regulations.)*
