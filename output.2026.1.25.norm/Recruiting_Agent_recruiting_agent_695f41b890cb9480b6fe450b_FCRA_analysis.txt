ID: recruiting-agent-695f41b890cb9480b6fe450b
Log file: None
Regulation: FCRA
============================================================

Based on the provided `[AGENT_DEFINITION]`, here is the security and compliance assessment regarding the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Recruiting Agent" is an automated sourcing tool designed to identify potential candidates (leads) for employment or sales. It utilizes the **People Data Labs (PDL)** "Search for People" tool to aggregate professional contact information (Name, Job Title, Company, Location, Email) based on general criteria such as role, industry, and location. It compiles these leads into a Google Sheet and can automate email outreach via Gmail.

### 2. FCRA Applicability
**FCRA is likely NOT Applicable to this agent.**

*   **Reasoning:** The FCRA regulates "Consumer Reports" (background checks, credit reports, criminal history) used to determine eligibility for employment purposes (hiring, promotion, retention).
*   **Solicitation vs. Screening:** This agent is designed for **sourcing** (marketing/headhunting)—identifying a list of potential prospects to solicit for applications. It is not designed for **screening** (evaluating the background of a specific applicant who has already applied).
*   **Nature of Data:** The data retrieved (professional directory information) is used to initiate contact, not to make a final adverse employment decision (denying a job based on the report).
*   **Operational Constraints:** The agent's definition for the `Search for leads` node explicitly states: *"Avoid using to find specific person."* This instruction prevents the agent from being used effectively as a background check tool on specific applicants, keeping it firmly in the "Lead Generation" category.

### 3. Specific Violations of FCRA
**No definitive violations found.**

*   There is no evidence in the agent definition that it requests credit scores, criminal history, or other sensitive consumer data protected under FCRA.
*   There is no logic automating "Adverse Action" (rejecting a candidate) based on the data retrieved.
*   The agent functions as a directory search for outreach, which generally falls outside the scope of a Consumer Reporting Agency (CRA) activity under current regulatory interpretations.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
While the agent is compliant with FCRA in its current configuration, the following recommendation ensures continued compliance:

*   **Usage Disclaimer:** Although not strictly required if FCRA does not apply, it is best practice to include a system prompt or user warning stating: *"Data provided by this agent is for sourcing and contact purposes only and must not be used to determine eligibility for employment, credit, or housing."* This prevents users from attempting to misuse the raw data for screening purposes that might inadvertently trigger FCRA obligations.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
