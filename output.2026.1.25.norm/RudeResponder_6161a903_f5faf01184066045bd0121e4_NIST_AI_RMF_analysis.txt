ID: 6161a903-f5fa-f011-8406-6045bd0121e4
Log file: None
Regulation: NIST-AI-RMF
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition (`RudeResponder`) and the constraints of your request, here is the assessment regarding NIST AI Risk Management Framework (NIST AI RMF 1.0) compliance.

### 1. Summary of the Agent's Function
The agent is a **deterministic automation script** (specifically a Microsoft Power Automate/Logic App cloud flow).
*   **Trigger:** It monitors an Office 365 inbox for incoming emails where the subject line contains the string "marketing".
*   **Action:** When triggered, it automatically replies to the sender.
*   **Content:** The reply consists of the subject "Re: [Original Subject]" and a hardcoded body text: "Your marketing message is not appreciated."

### 2. NIST AI RMF Applicability
**NIST AI RMF is NOT Applicable.**

**Reasoning:**
The NIST AI RMF is designed specifically to manage risks associated with **Artificial Intelligence** systems. According to the NIST definition (aligned with OECD), an AI system infers how to generate outputs (predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions) based on objectives.

The `RudeResponder` agent:
1.  **Lacks Inference:** It utilizes a static string-matching filter (`subjectFilter: "marketing"`) and a hardcoded text response. It does not use Machine Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), heuristics, or statistical modeling.
2.  **Is Deterministic:** The inputs and outputs are governed by explicit "If-Then" logic (Rule-Based Automation) rather than probabilistic modeling.
3.  **No Training Data:** There is no model training, validation, or testing data involved.

As this is a standard Business Process Automation (BPA) script and not an AI system, the AI-specific risk characteristics (Explainability, Bias, Hallucination, Drift) addressed by NIST AI RMF are not present.

### 3. Specific Violations of NIST AI RMF
**No violations found.**

Because the framework is not applicable to this technology stack, the specific controls regarding TEVV (Test, Evaluation, Verification, and Validation) of AI models, explainability, or bias mitigation do not apply. There is no evidence in the definition that the system attempts to mimic AI behavior or utilizes AI components that would trigger compliance requirements under this specific framework.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
1.  **Reclassification:** Remove this agent from the "AI Risk Assessment" queue. It should be classified as "IT Automation" or "Scripting."
2.  **Governance Transfer:** Move the governance of this asset to standard IT or Email Policy compliance teams, as the risk here is related to business etiquette and communication policy, not AI safety.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**

*(Note: While the agent is technically "Out of Scope," it is marked Compliant because it does not violate any tenets of the NIST AI RMF, as it contains no AI components to manage.)*
