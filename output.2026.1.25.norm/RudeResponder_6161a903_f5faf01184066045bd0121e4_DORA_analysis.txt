ID: 6161a903-f5fa-f011-8406-6045bd0121e4
Log file: None
Regulation: DORA
============================================================

Here is the assessment of the agent based on the provided definition and DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) regulations.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, named "RudeResponder," is a simple automated workflow designed to filter incoming emails via Office 365.
*   **Trigger:** It monitors the inbox for new emails containing the string "marketing" in the subject line.
*   **Action:** Upon detection, it automatically replies to the sender with the subject line "Re: [Original Subject]" and a hardcoded body text: "Your marketing message is not appreciated."

### 2. DORA Applicability
**Applicable.**
DORA (Regulation (EU) 2022/2554) applies to financial entities and their ICT (Information and Communication Technology) assets. As a software script automating communication within the enterprise's environment, this agent constitutes an ICT asset. It relies on third-party services (Microsoft Office 365) and processes internal data (email), making it subject to the enterprise’s ICT Risk Management Framework as mandated by DORA.

### 3. DORA Violations
**None.**
Based on the provided definition and the strict requirement to identify only definitive, significant violations that present practical risk:

*   **Resilience and Availability:** The agent is a non-critical, low-complexity workflow. Its failure would not impact the availability of critical functions or the financial entity's continuity.
*   **ICT Third-Party Risk:** The agent utilizes a standard `shared_office365` connection. Assuming the enterprise has already vetted Microsoft as a critical ICT third-party provider (which is standard for large enterprises), this agent does not introduce unauthorized or unmanaged third-party risk.
*   **Data Integrity and Confidentiality:** The agent does not process, store, or transmit sensitive financial data or PII beyond the sender's email address (which is necessary for the function). It does not expose internal systems to external threats.
*   **Incident Detection:** The agent runs within the managed Power Automate environment, which generates standard logs (Run History). This satisfies basic traceability requirements for non-critical assets.

*Note: While the content of the email ("Your marketing message is not appreciated") may violate internal HR or Professional Conduct policies, it does not constitute a violation of digital operational resilience regulations.*

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
*   **No remediation required for DORA compliance.**
*   *Operational Note:* While not a regulatory violation, ensure the "Subject Filter" is sufficient to prevent email loops (e.g., if the sender also has an auto-responder). However, this is a low-level operational nuisance, not a DORA systemic risk.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**
