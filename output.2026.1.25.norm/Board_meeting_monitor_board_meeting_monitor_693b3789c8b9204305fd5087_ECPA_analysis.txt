Agent: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
ID: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
Log file: None
Regulation: ECPA
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition and the constraints of your request, here is the assessment regarding the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA).

### 1. Summary of the Agent's Function
The agent, titled "Board meeting monitor," is an automated workflow designed to run twice daily (at 09:00 and 18:00). Its primary function is to query a connected Calendar account for "board meetings" occurring the following day that start before 9:00 AM PT. Based on the time the agent runs, it routes a notification to a specific recipient:
*   **Morning run:** Sends an email via Gmail to `m@testco.com`.
*   **Afternoon run:** Sends an SMS via Twilio to `+14155312776`.

### 2. Whether ECPA is Applicable and Why
**Yes, ECPA is applicable.**
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act applies because the agent interacts with:
1.  **Stored Electronic Communications (Title II - Stored Communications Act):** The agent accesses stored calendar events and potentially email contents (via the Gmail integration).
2.  **Electronic Communications (Title I):** The agent generates and transmits electronic communications via SMS (Twilio) and Email (Gmail).

However, applicability does not equate to a violation. The act governs the *unauthorized* access to or *interception* of these communications.

### 3. Whether Specific Violations of ECPA are Found
**No specific violations of ECPA are found.**

*   **Title I (Interception):** The agent does not intercept communications in real-time (wiretapping). It utilizes standard, authorized APIs to send messages and read stored data. There is no evidence of "sniffing" or surreptitious interception of third-party traffic.
*   **Title II (Stored Communications Act):** The SCA prohibits accessing stored communications without authorization. This agent operates using specific tool configurations (`Calendar`, `Gmail`, `Twilio`). In an enterprise automation context, the presence of these configured nodes implies that the user (the "principal") has granted the agent (the "system") the necessary OAuth tokens or API credentials to act on their behalf.
*   **Consent Exception:** ECPA contains an exception for actions taken with the consent of a party to the communication. By configuring the agent to read the calendar and send messages, the user has provided implicit consent for these specific actions.

As the provided definition shows standard API usage and there is no sample log evidence indicating the agent is accessing accounts it was not configured to access (e.g., accessing a different user's calendar without permission), we must assume the access is authorized.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
**None required.**
The agent functions as a standard user-authorized automation tool. No remediation is necessary for ECPA compliance based on the provided definition.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**
