Log file: None
Regulation: SOC2
============================================================

Here is the assessment for the agent "RudeResponder" based on the provided definition.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent is an automated email workflow triggered by incoming emails via Office 365. It filters for emails containing the string "marketing" in the subject line. When triggered, it automatically replies to the sender with the subject "Re: [Original Subject]" and a hardcoded body text stating, "Your marketing message is not appreciated."

### 2. SOC 2 Applicability
**Applicable.**
SOC 2 controls are applicable to this agent because it interacts with the enterprise communication system (Office 365), processes incoming data (email metadata and content), and generates automated responses. Specifically, this falls under the Trust Services Criteria (TSC) regarding:
*   **Processing Integrity:** Ensuring system processing is complete, valid, accurate, and timely.
*   **Confidentiality:** Ensuring information designated as confidential is protected.

### 3. Specific Violations of SOC 2
**No violations found.**
Based on the provided definition and the instruction to assume no violation in the absence of evidence:
*   **Security/Access:** The agent utilizes standard, managed connection references (`shared_office365`) and secure authentication objects (`$authentication` type: `SecureObject`). It does not hardcode credentials or bypass enterprise identity management.
*   **Confidentiality:** The agent replies only to the originator of the email (`@triggerOutputs()?['body/from']`). It does not forward data to external, unverified endpoints, nor does it expose the data to unauthorized internal users.
*   **Processing Integrity:** The logic is deterministic and contained. There is no evidence of data manipulation or unauthorized modification of records beyond the intended auto-response.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **None.** The agent functions within the parameters of standard secure configuration for an auto-responder.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**
