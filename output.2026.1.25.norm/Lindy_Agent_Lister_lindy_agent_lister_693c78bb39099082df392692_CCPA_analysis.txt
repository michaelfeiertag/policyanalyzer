ID: lindy-agent-lister-693c78bb39099082df392692
Log file: None
Regulation: CCPA
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition (and noting that the [SAMPLE_LOG] was referenced but not included in the input text), here is the assessment regarding CCPA compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The **Lindy Agent Lister** is an administrative automation tool designed to run on a recurring hourly schedule (`0 * * * *`). Its primary function is to:
1.  Retrieve a list of all agents within the Lindy workspace.
2.  Iterate through this list using a control flow loop.
3.  Update or upsert a specific Google Sheet (`Lindy Agents`) with three specific data points for each agent: **AgentID**, **Agent Name**, and **Last Task Date**.

### 2. CCPA Applicability
**Applicability:** **Not Applicable** (to the specific data payload).

**Reasoning:**
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) regulates the processing of "Personal Information" (PI) of California residents (consumers). PI is defined as information that identifies, relates to, describes, or is reasonably capable of being associated with a particular consumer or household (e.g., real names, email addresses, IP addresses, biometric data).

Based on the `googleSheets-updateRowV3` configuration in the Agent Definition, this agent strictly processes:
*   `AgentID`: An internal system unique identifier for software.
*   `Agent Name`: A configuration label for software.
*   `Last Task Date`: A system operational timestamp.

This data constitutes **internal system telemetry and configuration metadata**. It does not qualify as Personal Information regarding a consumer or household. Therefore, the specific data processing actions of this agent do not fall under the purview of CCPA regulations.

### 3. Specific Violations of CCPA
**Violations Found:** **None.**

**Analysis:**
*   **Data Collection:** The agent does not collect consumer data; it collects system application data.
*   **Data Selling/Sharing:** The agent transmits data only to Google Sheets (a service provider context) for internal administrative purposes. There is no evidence of "selling" or "sharing" data for cross-context behavioral advertising.
*   **Right to Delete/Access:** As the data is not consumer PI, it does not trigger consumer rights requests (DSARs).

*Note: Per your instructions, as there is no evidence of a violation in the definition and the data structure is explicitly system-oriented, it is assumed there are no violations.*

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
No remediation is required for CCPA compliance.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
