Agent: recruiting-agent-695f41b890cb9480b6fe450b
ID: recruiting-agent-695f41b890cb9480b6fe450b
Log file: None
Regulation: GDPR
============================================================

Based on the provided **[AGENT_DEFINITION]**, here is the security and compliance assessment regarding GDPR. Note that the **[SAMPLE_LOG]** was referenced in your text but not provided in the data block; however, the agent definition contains explicit instructions that constitute definitive compliance risks without needing a log to confirm.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Recruiting Agent" functions as an automated Sales Development Representative (SDR). Its primary workflow is:
1.  **Data Collection:** It searches a third-party data broker (People Data Labs) for individuals based on criteria (Role, Location, etc.).
2.  **Data Processing:** It extracts PII, specifically instructed to fetch **Personal Emails**, Full Names, Job Titles, and LinkedIn URLs.
3.  **Storage:** It exports this data into an unmanaged Google Sheet.
4.  **Action/Outreach:** It contains logic to iterate through this list and send emails via a connected Gmail account (cold outreach).

### 2. GDPR Applicability
**Status: Applicable**

GDPR is applicable to this agent for the following reasons:
*   **Processing of Personal Data (Article 4):** The agent explicitly processes "Full Name," "Personal Email," and "LinkedIn URL." These are identifiers that classify as Personal Data.
*   **Territorial Scope (Article 3):** The `searchForPeople` tool allows filtering by location but does not inherently block EU jurisdictions. If a user requests "Engineers in Berlin" or "Designers in Paris," the agent will process the data of EU data subjects.
*   **Professional/Commercial Context:** The processing is for recruiting and sales (commercial interest), meaning the "household exemption" does not apply.

### 3. Specific Violations
The following are definitive risks found in the agent's logic and configuration:

**A. Violation of Lawfulness of Processing (Article 6) & Direct Marketing Rules**
*   **Evidence:** Node `695f41b990cb9480b6fe4513` (Search for leads) explicitly instructs the AI: *"The bare minimum fields you should return is... **Personal Email**"*.
*   **Risk:** Processing **personal email addresses** (e.g., @gmail.com) for B2B recruiting/sales outreach without prior consent is a violation of GDPR and the associated ePrivacy Directive in most EU member states. While "Legitimate Interest" is often used for *corporate* email addresses, it rarely covers *personal* email addresses for cold outreach.

**B. Violation of Article 14 (Right to be Informed)**
*   **Evidence:** The agent aggregates data from a third party (People Data Labs) into a Google Sheet (Node `695f41b990cb9480b6fe4512`).
*   **Risk:** When data is obtained from a source other than the data subject (indirect collection), Article 14 requires the controller to inform the data subject that they hold their data within a reasonable period (max 30 days). This agent creates "Shadow IT" (spreadsheets of PII) with no mechanism to notify the subjects that their data has been collected.

**C. Violation of Storage Limitation and Security (Article 5)**
*   **Evidence:** Node `695f41b990cb9480b6fe4512` creates a new Google Sheet for every request.
*   **Risk:** The agent systematically exports PII out of the controlled environment (the agent/PDL) into static files (Google Sheets). This bypasses data retention policies. If a user exercises their **Right to Erasure (Article 17)** against your organization, you effectively cannot comply because this agent has scattered unmapped copies of PII across various Google Sheets.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
To bring this agent into compliance or reduce risk to an acceptable level:

1.  **Modify Data Collection Instruction:** Change the prompt in Node `695f41b990cb9480b6fe4513` to explicitly request **"Work Email"** instead of "Personal Email." Explicitly instruct the agent *not* to store or process personal email addresses.
2.  **Geofencing:** Hardcode constraints into the `searchForPeople` configuration to exclude EU countries unless the user has verified consent.
3.  **Disable Cold Outreach Logic:** The loop nodes (`695f41b990cb9480b6fe451b` through `695f41b990cb9480b6fe451e`) enable automated cold emailing. This should be disabled for EU targets, or the agent should be restricted to generating the list only, forcing the human user to handle the compliance burden of the actual outreach.
4.  **Centralized Storage:** Instead of creating a new Google Sheet, the agent should write to a centralized CRM or Applicant Tracking System (ATS) where GDPR retention policies and Right to Erasure requests can be managed centrally.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating

**NON-COMPLIANT**

The agent is designed to harvest personal contact information (Personal Emails) from third-party sources for the purpose of unconsented direct marketing/recruiting. This is a high-risk configuration under GDPR.
