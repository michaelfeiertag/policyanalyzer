Agent: meeting-scheduler-697192e92908dc843c114766
ID: meeting-scheduler-697192e92908dc843c114766
Log file: None
Regulation: PCI-DSS
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition, here is the assessment regarding PCI-DSS compliance.

### 1. Summary of the Agent's Function
The "Meeting Scheduler" agent is an administrative automation tool designed to coordinate calendar events via email. Its primary functions include:
*   Monitoring emails for scheduling requests.
*   Accessing calendar APIs to determine availability (free/busy status).
*   Generating email responses to propose meeting times.
*   Creating, rescheduling, or deleting calendar events/invites.
*   Generating Google Meet conference links.

### 2. PCI-DSS Applicability
**PCI-DSS is NOT Applicable.**

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) applies to entities that store, process, or transmit cardholder data (CHD) or sensitive authentication data (SAD).

*   **No Payment Functionality:** The agent's definition contains no tools, actions, or logic nodes capable of interacting with payment gateways, banking systems, or financial transaction APIs.
*   **No Data Collection:** The agent's prompt instructions and input variables focus exclusively on time, date, attendee names, and calendar preferences. There is no mechanism designed to solicit credit card numbers (PAN), CVV codes, or expiration dates.
*   **Scope:** As the agent does not handle financial transactions or cardholder data, it falls outside the scope of PCI-DSS regulatory requirements.

### 3. Specific Violations of PCI-DSS
**No violations found.**

A review of the agent's logic flows, tool configurations (`LindyMail`, `Calendar`), and prompt engineering reveals no evidence of non-compliance. The agent strictly processes unstructured text (email bodies) for temporal data (dates/times) and interacts with standard calendar APIs.

*Note: The [SAMPLE_LOG] was referenced in your prompt but not provided in the input. However, based on the strict logic definition provided, there is no evidence of a violation. As per your instructions, I assume none exists.*

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **No remediation necessary.** The agent is out of scope for PCI-DSS.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant** (Out of Scope)
