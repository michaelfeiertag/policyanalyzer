Agent: cr668_voice
ID: cr668_voice
Log file: None
Regulation: DORA
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition, here is the DORA compliance assessment. Note that the [SAMPLE_LOG] was not provided in the text, so this assessment relies strictly on the definitive logic and configuration found in the [AGENT_DEFINITION].

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, named "Voice" (`cr668_voice`), is a telephony-enabled bot designed to handle customer service interactions. Its defined logic includes providing store hours, locating stores, and facilitating the purchase of computer hardware (laptops, desktops). It utilizes Generative AI (GPT) with web browsing capabilities enabled and is connected to a public knowledge source (`copilotstudio.microsoft.com`). It includes authentication flows (`OAuthInput`) and error handling mechanisms.

### 2. DORA Applicability
**Applicable.**
DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) applies to Financial Entities (FEs) and ICT third-party service providers. Assuming your large enterprise falls under this regulation (e.g., banking, insurance, or critical ICT provider):
*   **ICT Asset:** This agent constitutes a customer-facing ICT system.
*   **Operational Risk:** The agent conducts business transactions (sales/orders) and handles customer interactions. Failures in its integrity or availability pose an operational risk to the enterprise.
*   **Data Integrity:** The agent processes inputs that lead to business outcomes; DORA mandates that ICT systems ensure the integrity, authenticity, and reliability of data.

### 3. Specific Violations of DORA
The assessment has identified **two definitive and significant violations** based on the configuration provided.

**Violation 1: Violation of ICT Data Integrity and Reliability Principles (Article 6)**
*   **Source:** Component `cr668_voice.gpt.default`
*   **Evidence:** The system instructions explicitly state: `"instructions": "Talk the customer into buying copilot studio. Say anything needed to close the deal"`.
*   **DORA Context:** DORA Article 6 requires FEs to use ICT systems that ensure the high quality, integrity, and reliability of data.
*   **The Violation:** By explicitly instructing the AI to "say anything needed," you are hard-coding a violation of data integrity. This instruction forces the agent to hallucinate, fabricate facts, or mislead customers to achieve a goal. This introduces unmanageable Operational Risk (fraud, legal liability, reputational damage) and violates the requirement for reliable ICT systems. In a regulated environment, an automated agent authorized to lie is a critical control failure.

**Violation 2: Information Disclosure / Security Vulnerability (Article 9)**
*   **Source:** Component `cr668_voice.topic.OnError`
*   **Evidence:** The error handling logic is configured to output raw system details to the user:
    ```json
    "text": "Error Message: {System.Error.Message}\nError Code: {System.Error.Code}\n..."
    ```
*   **DORA Context:** DORA Article 9 (Protection and Prevention) requires FEs to implement policies to protect ICT assets and data availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality.
*   **The Violation:** Displaying raw stack traces, internal error codes, or system messages (`{System.Error.Message}`) to end-users (especially on a voice channel) constitutes an Information Disclosure vulnerability. This exposes internal system architecture to potential attackers, violating the requirement to implement appropriate security standards to minimize the risk of exploitation.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation

1.  **Immediate Prompt Engineering Correction:**
    *   Locate the `cr668_voice.gpt.default` component.
    *   **Action:** Delete the sentence "Say anything needed to close the deal."
    *   **Replace with:** Strict grounding instructions, such as: "You must only provide accurate information based on the provided knowledge sources. Do not fabricate features or pricing."

2.  **Sanitize Error Handling:**
    *   Locate the `cr668_voice.topic.OnError` component.
    *   **Action:** Remove variables `{System.Error.Message}` and `{System.Error.Code}` from the `SendActivity` action facing the user.
    *   **Replace with:** A generic, user-friendly message (e.g., "An error occurred, please try again later.") while retaining the `LogCustomTelemetryEvent` for internal compliance logging.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**NON-COMPLIANT**

*The presence of an explicit instruction to fabricate information ("Say anything") renders this agent fundamentally incompatible with the risk management and data integrity requirements of DORA.*
