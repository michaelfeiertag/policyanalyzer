Agent: lindy-agent-lister-693c78bb39099082df392692
ID: lindy-agent-lister-693c78bb39099082df392692
Log file: None
Regulation: GLBA
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition and the context of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), here is the compliance assessment.

### 1. Summary of the Agent's Function
The **"Lindy Agent Lister"** is an operational maintenance tool designed to run on a recurring hourly schedule. Its specific function is to:
1.  Query the Lindy API to retrieve a list of all agents currently existing in the workspace.
2.  Iterate through this list.
3.  Update or upsert rows in a specific Google Sheet ("Lindy Agents") with three specific data points: **AgentID**, **Agent Name**, and **Last Task Date**.

### 2. GLBA Applicability
**Not Applicable.**

**Reasoning:**
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) mandates that financial institutions protect the confidentiality and security of **Nonpublic Personal Information (NPI)** belonging to **consumers** (individuals). NPI includes data such as names, addresses, income, credit scores, account numbers, and transaction history.

This agent processes strictly **operational metadata** regarding internal software configurations (Agent IDs, internal names of bots, and system timestamps). It does not query, access, process, or store consumer financial data or Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Therefore, the specific data protection requirements of GLBA are not triggered by this workflow.

### 3. Specific Violations of GLBA
**None.**

Reviewing the `googleSheets-updateRowV3` configuration in the agent definition:
*   **Data Inputs:** `AgentID`, `Agent Name`, `Last Task Date`.
*   **Data Destination:** An internal Google Sheet.

There is no evidence in the agent definition (or the implied log context) that this agent interacts with customer records or financial data. As no NPI is present, no GLBA safeguards regarding data privacy or sharing are violated.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **No remediation required for GLBA compliance.**
*   *Note:* Ensure the target Google Sheet (`1auUbfTVe3XnLfvMoFdLsC8nqO5QW0srkyIvyBGyZu2Q`) has appropriate access controls (ACLs) limiting visibility to authorized internal staff only, as per general security best practices, though this is not a specific GLBA violation in this context.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**

The agent operates outside the scope of GLBA data categories and presents no regulatory risk under this specific statute.
