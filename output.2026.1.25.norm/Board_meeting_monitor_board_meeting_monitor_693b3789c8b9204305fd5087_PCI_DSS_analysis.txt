ID: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
Log file: None
Regulation: PCI-DSS
============================================================

Based on the provided `[AGENT_DEFINITION]` and the instruction to assume no violations if no evidence exists (given the absence of the `[SAMPLE_LOG]` text in your prompt), here is the assessment.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Board meeting monitor" agent is a scheduling automation tool. It triggers twice daily (at 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM). Upon triggering, it searches a connected Calendar for board meetings scheduled for the following day that begin before 9:00 AM PT. Based on the time of day the agent runs (Logic node), it sends a notification either via Gmail (morning run) or Twilio SMS (afternoon/evening run) to specific recipients.

### 2. PCI-DSS Applicability
**Not Applicable.**

PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) applies to entities and systems that store, process, or transmit Cardholder Data (CHD) or Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD).

This agent interacts exclusively with:
*   **Calendar Data:** Meeting subjects, times, and descriptions.
*   **Communication Tools:** Gmail and Twilio for notification delivery.

There is no evidence in the agent definition that it connects to payment gateways, Point of Sale (POS) systems, financial databases, or handles credit card numbers (PAN), CVV codes, or expiration dates. As the data flow does not involve the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE), PCI-DSS scope does not apply.

### 3. Specific Violations
**None.**

*   **Data Storage/Transmission:** The agent transmits calendar event details to email and SMS. Unless users are explicitly entering credit card numbers into Calendar Invite Subject lines or Descriptions (which is highly irregular and speculative), no Cardholder Data is being transmitted over open public networks (email/SMS) in violation of PCI-DSS Requirement 4.
*   **Access Control:** There are no interactions with payment credentials.

### 4. Recommendations
No remediation is required for PCI-DSS compliance as the agent is out of scope.

*   *General Best Practice (Optional):* Ensure organizational policy dictates that employees never enter Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD) or Primary Account Numbers (PAN) into calendar event descriptions, as this agent would transmit that data via unencrypted channels (SMS/Email).

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Compliant**
