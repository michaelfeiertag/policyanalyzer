Agent: 6161a903-f5fa-f011-8406-6045bd0121e4
ID: 6161a903-f5fa-f011-8406-6045bd0121e4
Log file: None
Regulation: GLBA
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition and the instructions to focus strictly on GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) compliance, here is the assessment.

**Note on Sample Log:** The prompt referenced a `[SAMPLE_LOG]` but only provided `[AGENT_DEFINITION]`. As per your instructions, I have proceeded based on the definition provided. Since there is no evidence of a violation in the definition, I have assumed there is none.

### 1. Summary of the Agent's Function
The agent, named "RudeResponder," is a cloud flow automation (Logic App/Power Automate). It monitors an Office 365 email inbox for new messages where the subject line contains the string "marketing". When such an email is detected, the agent automatically replies to the sender with the subject "Re: [Original Subject]" and the body text "Your marketing message is not appreciated."

### 2. GLBA Applicability
**Applicability: Low / Not Applicable**

**Reasoning:**
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) applies to "financial institutions" and governs the protection and sharing of "Nonpublic Personal Information" (NPI) of consumers.
*   **Data Scope:** This agent is explicitly configured to filter for emails regarding "marketing" (`"subjectFilter": "marketing"`). Emails categorized as incoming marketing solicitations generally do not constitute NPI (consumer financial records, balances, credit histories, or account numbers).
*   **Action Scope:** The agent simply replies to the sender. It does not extract, store, process, or transmit data to third parties.

Unless the organization classifies incoming marketing solicitations as NPI (which is non-standard), this agent does not interact with regulated data.

### 3. Specific Violations
**Violations Found: None**

*   **Financial Privacy Rule:** The agent does not share data with non-affiliated third parties. It only replies to the originator of the message. Therefore, no opt-out notices or privacy policy updates are triggered by this specific workflow.
*   **Safeguards Rule:** The agent utilizes standard, authenticated Office 365 connectors (`shared_office365`). There is no evidence in the definition that it bypasses authentication or stores data in an unencrypted or insecure manner.
*   **Pretexting:** The agent does not attempt to access customer information under false pretenses.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **No remediation required for GLBA compliance.**
*   *Note:* While the agent is compliant with GLBA, no changes are necessary to satisfy this specific regulation.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
