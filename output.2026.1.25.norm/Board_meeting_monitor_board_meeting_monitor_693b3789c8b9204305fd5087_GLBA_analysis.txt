Agent: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
ID: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
Log file: None
Regulation: GLBA
============================================================

Based on the provided Agent Definition (and noting the absence of the [SAMPLE_LOG] in the prompt), here is the assessment regarding GLBA compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Board meeting monitor" is an automated workflow that runs twice daily (09:00 and 18:00). Its function is to access a connected Calendar and search for "board meetings" occurring the following day that start before 9 AM PT.
*   **Morning Trigger:** Sends the results via **Gmail** to `m@testco.com`.
*   **Afternoon Trigger:** Sends the results via **Twilio (SMS)** to `+14155312776`.

### 2. GLBA Applicability
**Applicability: Low / Unlikely**

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) mandates that financial institutions protect **Nonpublic Personal Information (NPI)** regarding **consumers** (individuals obtaining financial products/services).

*   **Data Type:** The agent accesses corporate calendar entries specifically querying for "board meetings."
*   **Context:** Board meetings generally involve corporate governance, strategy, and high-level financial reporting (Material Non-Public Information or MNPI), rather than individual consumer NPI (e.g., credit scores, individual loan applications, or account balances of retail customers).
*   **Conclusion:** Unless the enterprise places specific consumer names and account details directly into the titles/descriptions of Board Meeting calendar invites, this agent does not process the data class protected by GLBA.

### 3. Specific Violations (GLBA)
**No definitive violations found.**

*   **Privacy Rule:** There is no evidence that this agent shares consumer data with non-affiliated third parties without notice. The data is being sent to a corporate email address (`testco.com`) and a specific phone number (presumed to be an employee/officer).
*   **Safeguards Rule:**
    *   **Transmission:** Gmail and Twilio generally utilize encryption in transit.
    *   **Data Content:** As noted in the applicability section, the definition restricts the search to "board meetings." There is no evidence in the definition that this agent scrapes or exposes Consumer NPI.
*   **Note on Logs:** As no sample log was provided, the assessment relies strictly on the agent definition. Per your instructions ("If there is no evidence of a violation assume there is none"), we conclude no violation exists.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
While the agent is compliant with GLBA based on the definition, the following are best practices to maintain that compliance:

1.  **Data Hygiene:** Ensure that calendar invites for Board Meetings do not contain raw consumer NPI (e.g., "Review Loan for John Doe"). Keep consumer specifics in attached, secured documents rather than the calendar event body/description, which this agent can access.
2.  **Recipient Verification:** Verify that the phone number `+14155312776` belongs to an authorized corporate officer. While this is a general security control, under GLBA, limiting access to potential financial data to "need-to-know" individuals is required.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

*The agent functions as an internal administrative notification tool for corporate governance. It does not appear to target, process, or transmit the Consumer Nonpublic Personal Information (NPI) governed by GLBA.*
