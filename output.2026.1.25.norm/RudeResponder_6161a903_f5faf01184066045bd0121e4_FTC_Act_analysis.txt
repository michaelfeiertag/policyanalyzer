============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition for "RudeResponder," here is the assessment regarding compliance with the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act).

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent, titled "RudeResponder," automates email replies within an Office 365 environment.
*   **Trigger:** It monitors the inbox for new emails where the subject line contains the string "marketing".
*   **Action:** Upon detection, it automatically replies to the sender.
*   **Content:** The reply subject is "Re: [Original Subject]" and the body text is hardcoded to: "Your marketing message is not appreciated."

### 2. FTC Act Applicability
**Applicability:** **Low / Not Applicable to this specific workflow.**

The FTC Act (Section 5) prohibits "unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce."
*   **Deceptive Practices:** Involve material representations or omissions that mislead consumers.
*   **Unfair Practices:** Cause substantial injury to consumers that is not reasonably avoidable and not outweighed by benefits.

This agent functions as an internal automation tool to reject incoming correspondence. It is not generating consumer-facing advertising, making claims about products/services, collecting consumer data for monetization, or engaging in billing practices. Therefore, the core triggers for FTC Act scrutiny are absent in this workflow.

### 3. Specific Violations of FTC Act
**Violations Found:** **None.**

*   **No Deception:** The agent sends a truthful statement regarding the user's sentiment ("Your marketing message is not appreciated"). It does not misrepresent the identity of the sender or the nature of the business.
*   **No Unfairness:** The agent does not cause substantial injury to consumers. While the response is curt, replying to an email (even rudely) does not constitute "substantial injury" under the legal definition of the FTC Act.
*   **No Commercial Solicitation:** The agent is reacting to incoming mail, not initiating a commercial solicitation. It does not attempt to sell a product or service, therefore it does not fall under regulations governing deceptive advertising.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **No remediation is required** to satisfy the FTC Act.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
