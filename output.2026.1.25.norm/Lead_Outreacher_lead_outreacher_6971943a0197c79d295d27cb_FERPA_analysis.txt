Agent: lead-outreacher-6971943a0197c79d295d27cb
ID: lead-outreacher-6971943a0197c79d295d27cb
Log file: None
Regulation: FERPA
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition and the instructions to focus exclusively on FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act), here is the security and compliance assessment.

**Note on [SAMPLE_LOG]:** The sample log file referenced in your prompt was not included in the text provided. This assessment is based strictly on the `[AGENT_DEFINITION]` and the instruction to assume no violation if there is no evidence of one.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Lead Outreacher" agent functions as an autonomous Sales Development Representative (SDR). Its primary workflow is:
1.  **Ingest Data:** It triggers when a new row is added to a specific Google Sheet containing lead information.
2.  **Generate Content:** It uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate personalized sales emails based on the lead's name, company, and industry.
3.  **Execute Outreach:** It sends a sequence of three emails via Gmail (an initial outreach, a follow-up after 3 days, and a final "break-up" email).
4.  **Manage Timing:** It utilizes timers to space out the email sequence.

### 2. FERPA Applicability
**FERPA is NOT Applicable.**

**Reasoning:**
FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) applies to "educational agencies and institutions" that receive funding from the U.S. Department of Education. It specifically protects the privacy of **student education records** (e.g., grades, transcripts, disciplinary records, class schedules).

The Agent Definition explicitly describes a Business-to-Business (B2B) sales context.
*   **Evidence:** The prompts instruct the AI to reference "[Lead's Company]," "ROAS" (Return on Ad Spend), and "business goals."
*   **Data Type:** The data processed is commercial contact information (Leads), not student education records.

Even if this agent were deployed by a University (e.g., to sell research partnerships or contact vendors), the data being processed (business contact info of external leads) does not constitute an "education record" under 34 CFR Part 99.

### 3. Specific Violations of FERPA
**No violations found.**

There is no evidence in the agent definition that this system accesses, stores, or transmits Personally Identifiable Information (PII) derived from student education records. The agent operates strictly on sales leads provided via a Google Sheet for commercial outreach purposes.

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
*   **No remediation is required regarding FERPA.**
*   *Operational Note:* Ensure the Google Sheet connected to the agent (`...IvyBGyZu2Q`) is never populated with student data by mistake. As long as the input data remains commercial sales leads, FERPA compliance is maintained.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**

(The agent is compliant because the regulatory framework of FERPA does not apply to the specific data types and workflows defined in this agent.)
