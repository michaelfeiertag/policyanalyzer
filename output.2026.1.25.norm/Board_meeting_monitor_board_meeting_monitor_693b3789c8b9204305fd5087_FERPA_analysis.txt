Agent: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
ID: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
Log file: None
Regulation: FERPA
============================================================

Based on the provided agent definition and the instructions to rely on evidence rather than speculation, here is the assessment regarding FERPA compliance.

### 1. Summary of the Agent's Function
The agent, titled "Board meeting monitor," is designed to run on a recurring schedule twice daily (9:00 AM and 6:00 PM). Its function is to query a connected Calendar for "board meetings the next day that start before 9am PT."
*   If triggered in the morning, it sends an email notification to `m@testco.com`.
*   If triggered in the afternoon, it sends an SMS notification to a specific phone number (`+14155312776`).

### 2. FERPA Applicability
**Applicability: Low / Not Applicable**

FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) applies to educational agencies and institutions that receive funding from the U.S. Department of Education. It specifically protects "Education Records" (records directly related to a student and maintained by the institution) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) derived from them.

FERPA is likely **not applicable** to this specific agent for the following reasons:
1.  **Nature of Data:** The agent queries calendar events for "Board meetings." Board meetings are generally administrative or governance events. Unless the calendar event description specifically names a student (e.g., "Disciplinary Hearing for Student X"), the existence and time of a board meeting is not an "Education Record."
2.  **Context:** The recipient email domain is `@testco.com`, implying a corporate or enterprise environment rather than an educational institution. Even if this were a School Board, the schedule of meetings is typically public information (under Sunshine laws) rather than protected student data.

### 3. Specific Violations of FERPA
**Violations Found: None**

*   **No Student PII:** There is no evidence in the agent definition that it accesses, ingests, or transmits student grades, enrollment data, disciplinary records, or student PII.
*   **No Unauthorized Disclosure:** The data (meeting times) is being sent to specific, hardcoded recipients (a corporate email and a specific phone number). There is no dynamic sharing of data with unauthorized third parties.
*   **Log Evidence:** As no sample log was provided in the text, and the definition contains no inherent access to student databases, we must follow the instruction: "If there is no evidence of a violation assume there is none."

### 4. Specific Recommendations for Remediation
No remediation is required for FERPA compliance.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
