ID: recruiting-agent-695f41b890cb9480b6fe450b
Log file: None
Regulation: PCI-DSS
============================================================

Based on the review of the provided [AGENT_DEFINITION] for the "Recruiting Agent," here is the security and compliance assessment regarding PCI-DSS.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The "Recruiting Agent" is designed to function as a Sales Development Representative (SDR) or recruiter. Its primary workflows are:
*   **Lead Generation:** It accepts user criteria (role, location, industry) to search for professional contact information using the "People Data Labs" integration.
*   **Data Organization:** It creates Google Sheets and populates them with Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as Full Name, Job Title, Personal Email, and LinkedIn URLs.
*   **Outreach:** It includes logic to loop through generated leads and send outreach emails via a Gmail integration.

### 2. PCI-DSS Applicability
**Status: Not Applicable**

PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) applies solely to entities that store, process, or transmit Cardholder Data (CHD) (e.g., Primary Account Numbers) or Sensitive Authentication Data (SAD).

Based on the agent's definition, instructions, and tool configurations:
*   The agent connects to `PeopleDataLabs`, `GoogleSheets`, and `Gmail`. None of these integrations are configured to request, handle, or process financial transactions or payment data.
*   The data fields explicitly requested in the prompt configuration (Node `695f41b990cb9480b6fe4513`) are limited to: "Full Name, Job Title, Company Name, Location, Personal Email, LinkedIn URL."
*   There is no functionality enabling the agent to accept payments, access billing systems, or query credit card databases.

### 3. Specific PCI-DSS Violations
**No violations found.**

As the agent does not interact with the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE), it does not trigger any PCI-DSS requirements. The agent handles PII (Personally Identifiable Information), but it does not handle PCI data.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
*   **None required for PCI-DSS.** The agent is outside the scope of this regulation.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**COMPLIANT**
