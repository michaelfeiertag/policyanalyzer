Agent: meeting-scheduler-697192e92908dc843c114766
ID: meeting-scheduler-697192e92908dc843c114766
Log file: None
Regulation: GLBA
============================================================

Here is the assessment of the "Meeting Scheduler" agent regarding GLBA compliance.

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent functions as an automated Executive Assistant. It is triggered when CC'd on an email. It parses the email to understand scheduling intent, accesses the user's "Calendar" tool to identify free/busy times, and engages in an email exchange (via "LindyMail") to propose available slots. Once a time is agreed upon, it uses the "Calendar" tool to create a confirmed event. It also handles rescheduling requests by deleting and recreating events.

### 2. GLBA Applicability
**Applicable.**
GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) applies because this agent is deployed within a large enterprise (presumed to be a financial institution based on the context of the audit) and processes **Nonpublic Personal Information (NPI)**.

Specifically, the agent handles:
*   **Customer Names and Email Addresses:** (Personally Identifiable Financial Information).
*   **Meeting Context:** The agent logic (Node `697192e92908dc843c114770`) specifically extracts "a bit of context" to title the calendar event. In a financial setting, this context (e.g., "Estate Planning," "Loan Default Discussion") combined with the customer identity constitutes NPI.

As the agent mediates interactions between the institution and its clients, it is subject to the **GLBA Safeguards Rule** (protecting data security and access).

### 3. Specific Violations of GLBA
I have identified one definitive, significant violation based on the agent definition provided.

**Violation 1: Insecure Access Control / Failure to Isolate Customer Information (Safeguards Rule)**
*   **Evidence:** In Node `697192e92908dc843c114770` ("Schedule event"), the configuration for `conferenceLink` is set to `manual` with a hardcoded, static value: `https://meet.google.com/cbp-ybrq-ijr`.
*   **Analysis:** This configuration forces **every** meeting scheduled by this agent—regardless of the client or the sensitivity of the topic—to use the exact same video conference URL.
*   **GLBA Violation:** This violates the Safeguards Rule requirement to protect against unauthorized access to customer information.
    *   Because the link is static, Client A (who met at 1:00 PM) has the link to Client B's meeting (at 2:00 PM).
    *   If Client A rejoins the link or stays on the line, they can access the audio/video/screen-share of Client B’s session.
    *   This creates a high probability of commingling client data and unauthorized disclosure of NPI during live sessions.

### 4. Remediation Recommendations
To remediate the violation identified above:

1.  **Dynamic Link Provisioning:** Modify Node `697192e92908dc843c114770` ("Schedule event"). Remove the manual, static `conferenceLink` value. Configure the agent to use a tool that generates a **unique** meeting ID/URL for every separate event (or allow the Calendar provider's default integration to auto-generate a fresh link).
2.  **Data Minimization (Secondary Recommendation):** In the same node, the AI prompt for the event name instructs the agent to include "[a bit of context]". Ensure that the calendar writing these events does not have "Public" or "Organization-wide" visibility settings. If the calendar is shared internally, the agent should be instructed *not* to include sensitive context (like "Bankruptcy Hearing") in the event title to prevent internal NPI leakage.

### 5. Overall Compliance Rating
**Non-Compliant**

The agent introduces a critical security vulnerability by reusing a static conference bridge for all external client meetings, which fails to meet the access control standards required by GLBA.
