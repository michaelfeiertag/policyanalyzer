Agent: Board meeting monitor
ID: board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087
Log file: Board_meeting_monitor.csv
Regulation: GDPR
============================================================

Here is the compliance assessment for the agent "Board meeting monitor" (ID: `board-meeting-monitor-693b3789c8b9204305fd5087`).

### 1. Summary of Agent Function
The agent acts as an automated scheduler and notification system. It runs on a recurring daily schedule (9:00 AM and 6:00 PM) to query a specific Google Calendar for events matching the search term "Board meeting" scheduled for the following day.
*   **If triggered in the morning:** It checks the calendar and sends an **Email** (via Gmail) to a specific recipient (`m@testco.com`) with the results.
*   **If triggered in the evening:** It checks the calendar and sends an **SMS** (via Twilio) to a specific phone number (`+14155312776`) with the results.

### 2. GDPR Applicability
**Applicable.**

*   **Processing of Personal Data:** The agent explicitly processes Personal Data as defined in Article 4(1) of the GDPR. This includes:
    *   **Email Addresses:** Included in the calendar attendee lists and the hardcoded recipient (`m@testco.com`).
    *   **Phone Numbers:** Hardcoded mobile numbers for SMS delivery (`+1415...`, `+1510...`).
    *   **Names and Scheduling Data:** Calendar events for "Board meetings" invariably contain the names and email addresses of attendees (Board Members), who are natural persons.
*   **Enterprise Context:** While the sample logs show US-based phone numbers and Pacific Time (PT), Board of Directors data in large enterprises is inherently global. If a single board member or attendee is an EU resident, the processing of their calendar attendance status falls under GDPR scope.
*   **Material Sensitivity:** Board meetings are highly confidential; the metadata (who is attending, the description of the meeting) can reveal sensitive corporate strategy or personnel decisions.

### 3. Specific GDPR Violations
The following **definitive** violations present practical risk:

*   **Violation of Article 25: Data Protection by Design and Default (Hardcoded PII)**
    *   **Issue:** The agent configuration (JSON) contains hardcoded Personal Identifiable Information (PII) directly within the logic nodes.
    *   **Evidence:**
        *   Node `693b3810...` (Gmail) explicitly defines the recipient `to` address as `["m@testco.com"]`.
        *   Node `693b38d0...` (Twilio) explicitly defines `phoneNumberTo` as `+14155312776`.
    *   **Risk:** This violates the principle of Privacy by Design. By embedding personal contact details into the application code/configuration, this PII is exposed to anyone with administrative access to the agent definition or anyone viewing the source code/export, rather than being handled as a secure, variable input.

*   **Violation of Article 5(1)(c): Data Minimization**
    *   **Issue:** The processing is excessive in relation to the purpose. The purpose is a binary check: "Is there a meeting?" or a simple count. However, the `Calendar.listEvents` action retrieves the full event metadata.
    *   **Evidence:** The Action Definition for `listEvents` outputs a schema containing `attendees` (names, emails, response status), `description`, `location`, and `conferenceData`.
    *   **Risk:** To determine if a meeting exists, the agent does not need to process the PII of every attendee or read the meeting description (which may contain sensitive data). Passing the full attendee list of a Board Meeting to the LLM constitutes unnecessary processing of sensitive personnel data.

*   **Violation of Article 32: Security of Processing (Board Level Data)**
    *   **Issue:** The agent uses a generic, broad-access OAuth scope (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly`) to read Board-level calendar events.
    *   **Evidence:** The `ActionNode` (Google Calendar) utilizes a connection that has access to all event details.
    *   **Risk:** "Board meetings" often involve Material Non-Public Information (MNPI). Processing this data through a general-purpose agent without specific filters or encryption on the `description` field exposes the enterprise to data leaks if the LLM retains or logs the full event payload.

### 4. Recommendations for Remediation
1.  **Remove Hardcoded PII:** Update the agent configuration to remove `m@testco.com` and `+14155312776` from the static fields. Replace these with dynamic variables or environment secrets injected at runtime.
2.  **Implement Field Masking/Filtering:** Configure the `Calendar.listEvents` action to restrict the API response. The agent should only request `id`, `summary`, and `start/end` time. It should explicitly **exclude** `description` and `attendees` to ensure no sensitive board agenda items or member lists are passed to the AI model.
3.  **Scope Restriction:** Create a dedicated "Service Account" for this agent that only has access to a specific, public-facing calendar, rather than granting it read access to the primary user's entire calendar which includes Board invites.

### 5. Compliance Rating
**NON-COMPLIANT**

The agent embeds PII directly in its source configuration and over-collects highly sensitive data (Board attendee lists and descriptions) for a simple notification task, violating Privacy by Design and Data Minimization principles.
